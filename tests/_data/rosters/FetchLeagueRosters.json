The rushing production is ...","description":"The unanimous MVP last year, Jackson had arguably the most dominant season by a QB in NFL history. The rushing production is obvious - QB records for rushing yards (1,206) and rushes of 10-plus yards (47). But Jackson also proved his critics wrong, as his passing was nearly as historic. He threw a league-high 36 TD passes on 401 attempts for an 8.98 TD pass percentage, the highest since 1977, save for Peyton Manning's 2004 season (9.86). What's more, with only six interceptions (1.49 INT percentage), Jackson became one of three QBs in NFL history with a TD pass rate higher than 8.55 and an INT rate lower than 1.50. The others? Tom Brady (2007) and Aaron Rodgers (2011). Jackson's improvement in accuracy saw his completion percentage increase by nearly 10 points from his rookie year, vaulting from bottom 5 to top 10. And his bad-pass percentage went from 24.7, third highest in the NFL, to 19.2 percent, sandwiched between Russell Wilson (19.0) and Rodgers (19.3). Jackson was untouchable in the red zone, throwing 24 TD passes without an INT and a 40.0 TD pass percentage, third highest since 1991. That's bound to regress closer to the league average of 23.2 percent, but perhaps Jackson's overall regression in efficiency will be offset somewhat by increased attempts (401 last season, 26th). And Jackson could lose about 20 rushing yards per game and still finish the season with the third most rushing yards by a QB in league history. The receiving corps looks solid after a promising rookie campaign by Marquise Brown and a breakout season by TE Mark Andrews. RG Marshal Yanda retired, but the line still has standout tackles. Even if regression comes calling, Jackson can afford to take a hit and remain elite."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e06a9c07-453a-4bb0-a7e9-2c3a64166dad"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":7,"mean":{"value":232.125,"formatted":"232.1"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":1.5625,"formatted":"1.6"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":20.190624,"formatted":"20.2"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":408.68,"formatted":"408.68"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":66.084785,"formatted":"66.1"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3127.0,"formatted":"3,127"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":36.0,"formatted":"36"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":27.245333,"formatted":"27.25"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":2,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":1,"formatted":"1","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":26,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"QB2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":28.82,"formatted":"28.82"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":28.23,"formatted":"28.23"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":28.45,"formatted":"28.45"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":408.68,"formatted":"408.68"},"seasonAverage":{"value":27.245333,"formatted":"27.25"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.962783,"formatted":"6.96"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":309,"nameFull":"Tom Brady","nameShort":"T.

We'll soon find out, because the 43-year-old Brady has no shortage of weapons at his new home in Tampa Bay. Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and the unretired Rob Gronkowski give Brady a more explosive trio of receivers than he's had in years. Brady had a league-leading 40 throwaways last season as his receivers failed to get open, but his environment can't shoulder all the blame. His bad-pass percentage rose to 19.6 (13th) and his 8.1-yard average depth of target ranked 22nd. Never fleet of foot, Brady really struggled under pressure, posting the lowest completion percentage (30.2) and YPA in the league (2.9). He was no better on play action, ranking last in completion percentage (58.9). His play really suffered in the second half of the season, too, as he lost nearly 10 points off his completion percentage while his YPA dropped to a mere 5.9 after Week 10. His new crew figures to benefit him in the red zone where he had the league's third-lowest TD pass percentage last season (14.3). And an aggressive offense under coach Bruce Arians should also afford plenty of downfield opportunities - Brady attempted 55 passes longer than 20 yards last season; Arians' QB, Jameis Winston, attempted 98. Brady was middle of the pack on most downfield metrics last year, and with better receivers, he could see improved numbers. Still, his arm strength and skills are more likely to keep eroding than make a comeback."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"41c44740-d0f6-44ab-8347-3b5d515e5ecf"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6163,"away":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":260.375,"formatted":"260.4"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":1.625,"formatted":"1.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":21.75625,"formatted":"21.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":260.68,"formatted":"260.68"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":60.848286,"formatted":"60.8"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4057.0,"formatted":"4,057"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":24.0,"formatted":"24"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":16.2925,"formatted":"16.29"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":19,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":12,"formatted":"12"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":88,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":11,"formatted":"QB11"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":14.84,"formatted":"14.84"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":15.0,"formatted":"15"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.02,"formatted":"16.02"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":260.68,"formatted":"260.68"},"seasonAverage":{"value":16.2925,"formatted":"16.29"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.3967276,"formatted":"6.4"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":7371,"nameFull":"Mark Ingram","nameShort":"M.

The 30-year-old enjoyed a strong first season as a Raven last year, scoring a career-high 15 touchdowns and recording his third 1,000-yard rushing season. Ingram's powerful running style and balanced skill set made him a good fit in Baltimore alongside Lamar Jackson, and defenders had trouble bringing him down on initial contact without some help, as Ingram placed 17th in broken tackle rate and 10th in average yards after contact (2.6). But Gus Edwards also was effective (5.3 YPC) in offensive coordinator Greg Roman's celebrated scheme, and the Ravens unexpectedly made a big addition to their backfield in the form of second-round pick J.K. Dobbins. The rookie may start out by simply taking over Edwards' old role, but early success likely would lead to more carries, and it'll be tough for the Ravens to match last year's league-high 596 rush attempts. Given his age and the tough competition for touches, there's probably nowhere for Ingram to go but down compared to last season's production."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"externalIds":[{"id":"f336567d-44a9-4245-8452-1dd485fd70fb"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":150.0625,"formatted":"150.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":16.7375,"formatted":"16.7"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":229.50002,"formatted":"229.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1018.0,"formatted":"1,018"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":26.0,"formatted":"26"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":247.0,"formatted":"247"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":15.0,"formatted":"15"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":15.300001,"formatted":"15.3"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":28,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"8","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":52,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":22,"formatted":"RB22"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":16.1,"formatted":"16.1"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":16.2,"formatted":"16.2"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.02,"formatted":"16.02"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":229.50002,"formatted":"229.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":15.300001,"formatted":"15.3"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.821677,"formatted":"7.82"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12975,"nameFull":"Joe Mixon","nameShort":"J.

The third-year back didn't record his first 100-yard rushing game until Week 10 and didn't score his first rushing TD until Week 11. It's arguably a testament to Mixon's talent that his season totals look as palatable as they do given his washout first half. A big, powerful runner with surprising nimbleness, the 6-1, 220-pound Mixon is a prototypical three-down back who adds some value in passing situations while also wearing down defenses with his physicality. Neither Mixon nor Giovani Bernard saw a big increase in receiving usage last year, which was somewhat surprising given Taylor's background working under Sean McVay for the Rams. Cincinnati finished 30th in points and 26th in yards, despite being sixth in pace and ninth in total plays run. Better days should be ahead, though. With No. 1 pick Joe Burrow stepping in at quarterback, A.J. Green returning from an ankle injury and the potential for better offensive line play with last year's first-round pick Jonah Williams healthy, the offense should be more efficient this season, and that improvement is likely to extend to Mixon. There's been some chatter about a potential contract holdout, but Mixon hadn't made an announcement at press time."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"externalIds":[{"id":"7797f36e-87e8-4282-b6d2-bdb1774fc3b3"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":136.3125,"formatted":"136.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":15.95625,"formatted":"16"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":207.90002,"formatted":"207.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1137.0,"formatted":"1,137"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":35.0,"formatted":"35"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":287.0,"formatted":"287"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.993752,"formatted":"12.99"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":44,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":12,"formatted":"12","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":10,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":7,"formatted":"RB7","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":30.1,"formatted":"30.1"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":18.5,"formatted":"18.5"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":19.32,"formatted":"19.32"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":207.90002,"formatted":"207.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.993752,"formatted":"12.99"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.4449167,"formatted":"7.44"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13325,"nameFull":"Austin Ekeler","nameShort":"A.

Ekeler's usage fell after that, but he still had moments to shine later in the year, including a 213-yard eruption against the Jaguars in Week 14. Heading into his fourth NFL season, the undrafted rookie out of Western State Colorado seems set as the Chargers' new No. 1 back with Gordon now a Bronco, giving Ekeler his chance to dispel the notion - once and for all - that he's only a passing-down specialist. His agility and low pad level have always made him difficult to bring down on first contact, and his broken tackle rate was 14th in the league among backs with at least 100 carries - comparable to bulky runners like Derrick Henry and Mark Ingram. Ekeler may need to find extra production on the ground, however, as Philip Rivers' departure for Indianapolis will give the Bolts offense a different look this season. The scheme won't change with offensive coordinator Shane Steichen returning, but Rivers' penchant for flipping passes to his backs is legendary - something that neither Tyrod Taylor nor Justin Herbert is likely to match. Ekeler will hope to make up for it with additional rushing volume and potentially more snaps, taking the lead over Justin Jackson and rookie fourth-round pick Joshua Kelley in the Chargers backfield."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e5b8c439-a48a-4f83-b63b-1a4d30e04cd3"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":154.4375,"formatted":"154.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":12.7625,"formatted":"12.8"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":262.0,"formatted":"262"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":557.0,"formatted":"557"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":92.0,"formatted":"92"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":993.0,"formatted":"993"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":11.0,"formatted":"11"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":16.375,"formatted":"16.38"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":18,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":6,"formatted":"6","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":27,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":13,"formatted":"RB13","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":13.4,"formatted":"13.4"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":10.8,"formatted":"10.8"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":15.28,"formatted":"15.28"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":262.0,"formatted":"262"},"seasonAverage":{"value":16.375,"formatted":"16.38"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.283453,"formatted":"8.28"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":9380,"nameFull":"Keenan Allen","nameShort":"K.

Last year, he had his usual 100-catch, 1,200-yard, six-TD effort, though at the cost of some efficiency, likely due to an aging Philip Rivers. This year, Rivers is gone, and the Chargers are going with rookie Justin Herbert and veteran Tyrod Taylor at quarterback. Taylor is an elite scrambler and rarely turns the ball over, but aside from 14 games in 2015, has never cracked 7.0 YPA. Herbert's a good athlete with a big frame, but he was inconsistent at Oregon and likely will have some adjusting to do during his first exposure to the NFL. At 6-2, 211, Allen has good size, but he's never been much of a red-zone presence, and with both Hunter Henry and Mike Williams around, that's not likely to change in 2020. Allen isn't fast or even especially quick, but he runs excellent routes, has good hands and knows how to get open. Bottom line, Allen should remain the team's top target out wide, but with Taylor/Herbert at quarterback and Shane Steichen calling plays, this could be one of the more run-heavy teams in the league. Mike Williams is still the big-play option, and both Williams and Henry are better suited to see goalline work. Throw in Austin Ekeler as an elite receiver out of the backfield, and Allen's set-up is the worst of his career."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"5f424505-f29f-433c-b3f2-1a143a04a010"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":164.125,"formatted":"164.1"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":9.403125,"formatted":"9.4"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":209.50002,"formatted":"209.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":104.0,"formatted":"104"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1199.0,"formatted":"1,199"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.093751,"formatted":"13.09"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":42,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"8","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":57,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":26,"formatted":"WR26"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":18.7,"formatted":"18.7"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":14.07,"formatted":"14.07"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.76,"formatted":"13.76"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":209.50002,"formatted":"209.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.093751,"formatted":"13.09"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.053837,"formatted":"8.05"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":8493,"nameFull":"T.Y.

For starters, superstar quarterback Andrew Luck retired in summer, forcing Hilton to pair with an overmatched and inaccurate Jacoby Brissett. Then Hilton missed Week 4 with a quad injury before a Week 8 calf injury destroyed the rest of his season. He returned in Week 12, and again for the last three games of the year, but he was a shell of his former self. After the year, Hilton revealed his calf tear was three centimeters wide (that's big), but the muscle should heal on its own over the offseason, and he's expected to be healthy heading into the final year of his contract. At 5-10, 183, Hilton is small but lightning quick and has always punished defenses down the field with his 4.34 speed. Other than last year and 2016, Hilton's had at least five catches of more than 40 yards every season since 2012. He's an excellent route runner, has good hands and has long been one of the toughest one-on-one covers in the league. But Hilton turned 30 last November, and two soft-tissue injuries make him riskier than he once was. Moreover, while new quarterback Philip Rivers should be a significant upgrade over Brissett, Rivers is deep into the downside of his career and still a major drop-off from peak Luck. On the bright side, Hilton should be the team's clear top target again, with Zach Pascal, Parris Campbell and rookie Michael Pittman competing for second and third fiddle."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"externalIds":[{"id":"b8426cea-f8b9-4061-8d56-e70d1230103e"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":158.0,"formatted":"158"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":0.625,"formatted":"0.6"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":9.3,"formatted":"9.3"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":102.6,"formatted":"102.6"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":45.0,"formatted":"45"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":501.0,"formatted":"501"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.26,"formatted":"10.26"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":142,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":57,"formatted":"57","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":55,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":25,"formatted":"WR25"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.7,"formatted":"8.7"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":5.77,"formatted":"5.77"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.4,"formatted":"5.4"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":102.6,"formatted":"102.6"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.26,"formatted":"10.26"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.685835,"formatted":"6.69"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":15608,"nameFull":"K.J.

To cite but one stat, in his four starts he totaled just two completions on attempts longer than 20 yards. The Jaguars traded him to the Bears this offseason for a fourth-round pick, which is probably the best thing that could have happened to him and why he was agreeable to restructuring his contract (he'll still make $21 million guaranteed the next three seasons). Not only will Foles compete for the starting job with fourth-year QB Mitchell Trubisky, but he might actually have the inside track now that he's reunited with much of the offensive coaching staff. Foles played under Matt Nagy in 2012 with the Eagles and then in 2016 when Nagy was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator. He also played for quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo the year he led the Eagles to the Super Bowl. And Bears offensive coordinator Bill Lazor was Foles' QB coach during his breakout season in 2013 with the Eagles. Nagy said he will give Foles and Trubisky equal reps in training camp. Considering the team declined Trubisky's fifth-year option, even if Trubisky wins the job, the leash figures to be short. Trubisky's arm strength and mobility are superior, but Foles has veteran experience to fall back on and better decision-making skills. Either way, both QBs might have trouble surviving a poor offensive line, and Allen Robinson is really the only difference-maker to target in the passing game."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"externalIds":[{"id":"c8232b55-6617-4dd9-a7cf-cf14cd9a29ab"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6160,"away":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":295.8125,"formatted":"295.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":2.0625,"formatted":"2.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":24.565624,"formatted":"24.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":37.74,"formatted":"37.74"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":65.811966,"formatted":"65.8"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":736.0,"formatted":"736"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.435,"formatted":"9.44"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":279,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":43,"formatted":"43","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":225,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":32,"formatted":"QB32","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":-1.98,"formatted":"-1.98"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":10.25,"formatted":"10.25"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":9.43,"formatted":"9.43"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":37.74,"formatted":"37.74"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.435,"formatted":"9.44"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.6896596,"formatted":"7.69"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":11455,"nameFull":"Raheem Mostert","nameShort":"R.

A 151-yard eruption in Week 2 made him a waiver-wire darling, and while he had ups and downs afterward, by season's end he had moved to the top of the depth chart in Kyle Shanahan's RB-friendly offense. Mostert found the end zone at least once in every game Weeks 12 to 17, piling up 515 scrimmage yards and eight total scores in those six games, before sending the Packers home in the NFC championship game with 220 rushing yards and four touchdowns. Not bad for a guy who was typecast as a special teams player and bounced through five organizations in his first three NFL seasons after going undrafted out of Purdue. Mostert's best asset is his electric speed in the open field - he runs a 4.34 40 - and no back in the league turned a larger percentage of his carries into gains of at least 15 yards. He even flashed a bit of power when necessary, ranking 18th among 46 qualified running backs in broken tackle rate and 23rd in average yards after contact (2.2). Mostert said he bulked up this offseason in anticipation of a larger workload this year, though Tevin Coleman and Jerick McKinnon remain on the roster, while Matt Breida was traded to Miami in April. Shanahan's long-standing preference for multi-player backfields makes a bell-cow role for Mostert unlikely, but even a modest increase in volume to 200 carries could allow for a big impact in an efficient offense."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"b040e601-ec40-4757-bf3d-71bf64ef99cf"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":148.3125,"formatted":"148.3"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.8125,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":14.0875,"formatted":"14.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":158.20001,"formatted":"158.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":772.0,"formatted":"772"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":14.0,"formatted":"14"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":180.0,"formatted":"180"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.887501,"formatted":"9.89"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":89,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":24,"formatted":"24"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":62,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":25,"formatted":"RB25"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":19.8,"formatted":"19.8"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":13.83,"formatted":"13.83"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":17.56,"formatted":"17.56"},"duration":5,"overPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":158.20001,"formatted":"158.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.887501,"formatted":"9.89"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.153592,"formatted":"8.15"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12114,"nameFull":"Jordan Howard","nameShort":"J.

After signing a two-year deal with Miami, Howard will form the thunder half of a backfield duo with fellow offseason import Matt Breida, who figures to see more of the targets and the outside-the-tackles carries.

His YPC plummeted to a career-low 3.2 last year, and his 30 receptions on 43 targets were also the lowest volume he's seen as a receiver since he came into the league. With Joe Mixon locked into a three-down role, there wasn't much action left for Bernard last year, but he also wasn't effective enough with the touches he got to demand a larger share. When he gets the ball in space, he can still do some damage, but the quickness and elusiveness he displayed before his 2017 ACL tear never seemed to fully return. On the bright side, the Bengals offensive line should be better this season (it could hardly be worse), and Joe Burrow provides some optimism for the offense as a whole.

He averaged 13.8 YPC and 8.0 YPT, had three catches of 40-plus yards and scored six times, despite rarely being targeted in the red zone - nine targets all year, none from inside the 10. At 5-10, 197, Tate is stout, strong and fast, and he's long made his living on damage done after the catch. He's probably lost a half step from his 4.42 40 speed at the 2010 combine, but he still made big plays, despite playing mostly with a rookie quarterback. This year, there's extra competition for targets with Darius Slayton emerging and Sterling Shepard due back from a concussion-marred season. Tight end Evan Engram is also ostensibly healthy, and tailback Saquon Barkley will see plenty of targets in Jason Garrett's offense. Tate will usually line up in the slot, though Shepard also sees snaps there, as does Engram. But Tate is easily the most durable of the three, and given Shepard's concussion history and Engram's everything history, Tate has a good chance to maintain his significant role. There's some small chance Tate gets released by the Giants, but this is only the second year of his deal, and he'd leave behind a cap charge of approximately $7.5 million were they to cut him."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"externalIds":[{"id":"c88d9352-b835-45ed-a909-1cfec09a58bc"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6165,"away":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600125300000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":139.3125,"formatted":"139.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":0.8125,"formatted":"0.8"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":7.440625,"formatted":"7.4"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":127.700005,"formatted":"127.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":49.0,"formatted":"49"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":676.0,"formatted":"676"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.609092,"formatted":"11.61"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387301,"name":"Swamp Cats","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1387301_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":113,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":44,"formatted":"44"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":131,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":51,"formatted":"WR51","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":15.3,"formatted":"15.3"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":13.17,"formatted":"13.17"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.38,"formatted":"10.38"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":127.700005,"formatted":"127.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.609092,"formatted":"11.61"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.701267,"formatted":"5.7"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13333,"nameFull":"Zach Pascal","nameShort":"Z.

He's athletic - 36-inch vertical, 126-inch broad jump - but not especially quick or shifty. He'll compete for targets with T.Y. Hilton, Parris Campbell and rookie Michael Pittman, but Eric Ebron is gone, and the Colts likely upgraded at quarterback by signing the current incarnation of Philip Rivers.

The Ravens were fortunate enough to pick up Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews in the same draft, which meant Hurst spent his first two NFL seasons operating as the No. 3 tight end in a run-heavy offense. His big chance lies ahead in Year 3, following an offseason trade that saw the Falcons surrender a second-round pick for the TE with 4.67 speed. At 6-4, 245, Hurst figures to take over the same starting role that led Austin Hooper to 7.5 targets per game last year, considering the other candidates for playing time are 2018 UDFA Jaeden Graham and XFL star Khari Lee. Wideouts Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley could account for about 300 targets, but running back Todd Gurley is the only other proven commodity as a pass catcher, and it's not even clear he's still an asset. In any case, there should be enough volume to go around, as the combination of poor defense and solid QB play from Matt Ryan has allowed the Falcons to eclipse 4,500 team receiving yards seven times in the last eight seasons.

Last year, no wide receiver cracked 500 yards for the team that attempted the eighth most passes. Jeffery came the closest with 490 in 10 games, but per usual, injuries did him in, this time a Lisfranc fracture that required surgery in December. While Jeffery is expected to heal prior to training camp, it's a difficult injury, especially for a player of his size. Moreover, there have been offseason rumors of a rift between Jeffery and QB Carson Wentz, creating the possibility of a trade. Should he return to health, Jeffery will be playing somewhere. At 6-3, 218, he's massive, and his 80-inch wingspan is akin to that of an NBA shooting guard. At his peak, Jeffery ran a 4.48 40, but at 30 years old and with his history of injuries, those days likely are gone. Last year, Jeffery managed only 11.4 YPC and 6.7 YPT, both career lows, and had only six catches of 20-plus yards. While TE Zach Ertz has long been Wentz's favorite target, the rest of the Eagles' receiving corps is thin even with 33-year old deep threat DeSean Jackson presumably returning to health and first-round pick Jalen Reagor joining the team.

Wilson topped 4,000 passing yards for the third time in his career and 30 TD passes for the third consecutive year, finishing QB3 in fantasy. Despite nearly 100 more attempts than the previous season, Wilson was still highly efficient, as his YPA was nearly identical to 2018's (8.1 vs. 8.0), ranking third among QBs with at least 500 attempts. His 66.1 completion percentage was the second highest of his career, and he threw a career-low five interceptions - only Aaron Rodgers had a lower INT percentage (0.7) than Wilson's 1.0. Wilson's deep passing is what truly sets him apart. His 9.7-yard average depth of target ranked fourth (min. 300 attempts), and he was third in passer rating (103.7) on attempts longer than 20 yards (min. 45 attempts). He isn't shy about going downfield, either - 74 attempts longer than 20 yards last season (3rd) and a league-high 221 deep attempts since 2017, 26 more than anyone. That should serve him well again with favorite target Tyler Lockett coming off his first 1,000-yard season. And DK Metcalf, who surpassed expectations as a rookie, should be an even bigger weapon as a sophomore. Newcomer Greg Olsen gives Wilson another reliable target, but the backfield is unsettled with Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny coming off season-ending injuries. Sacks are always a concern - an NFL-record seven straight seasons with at least 40 sacks - but Wilson's scrambling adds to his fantasy output. While his attempts likely won't increase much, his efficiency, deep-ball skills and rushing output make him a safe QB target with upside."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"externalIds":[{"id":"409d4cac-ee90-4470-9710-ebe671678339"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"min":2,"max":30,"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6156,"away":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"home":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":256.6875,"formatted":"256.7"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.75,"formatted":"1.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":22.81875,"formatted":"22.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":323.6,"formatted":"323.6"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":66.08527,"formatted":"66.1"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4110.0,"formatted":"4,110"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":31.0,"formatted":"31"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":20.225,"formatted":"20.23"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":4,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":60,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":4,"formatted":"QB4","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":20.22,"formatted":"20.22"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":16.51,"formatted":"16.51"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":15.2,"formatted":"15.2"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":323.6,"formatted":"323.6"},"seasonAverage":{"value":20.225,"formatted":"20.23"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.648964,"formatted":"9.65"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":325,"nameFull":"Drew Brees","nameShort":"D.

For the third year in a row, Brees led the league in completion percentage with historic accuracy. His last three years rank, respectively, second (74.3), first (74.4) and third (72.0) in completion percentage all-time. That's the product of a short-passing game that rarely asks Brees to go deep. Just 6.8 percent of his attempts went longer than 20 yards last year, fewest in the league save for Jimmy Garoppolo (5.6). What's more, 58.2 percent of his attempts went no farther than five yards - only Derek Carr had a higher percentage of short passes (min. 300 attempts). Not surprisingly, Brees' 6.9-yard average depth of target was third lowest (again besting only Garoppolo and Carr). A Week 2 thumb injury cost him five games, but Brees still threw 27 TD passes, only five fewer than his 15-game 2018, thanks to an unsustainable 32.1 red-zone TD pass percentage (league average is 23.2 percent). At this point, Brees carries more risk than upside - he can't get more efficient, and without big-play opportunities or a sudden revival of 600-plus attempts (and no rushing cushion to speak of), his fantasy output will take a hit if his efficiency wanes, which at 41 would not shock. It's also conceivable he could lose some attempts to Taysom Hill, whom the team considers its QB of the future. Brees signed a two-year extension to return for his 20th season and chase another Super Bowl.

While he was expected to lose touches to Rashaad Penny, he instead held off his challenger and saw an even bigger workload than he had the year before, as he showed a little more utility in the passing game while retaining his lead role on the ground. Carson does not do anything fancy with the ball, but his size (5-11, 222) and physical running style make him a load to bring down - he finished top 7 in broken tackles in both 2018 and 2019. He also averaged 2.6 yards per carry after contact last year, good for ninth in the league. With Penny recovering from an ACL tear and unlikely to be healthy for Week 1, Carson perhaps has less competition for snaps to begin the season, though the Seahawks drafted DeeJay Dallas in the fourth round and signed Carlos Hyde. Assuming his workload remains steady, there's still room for improvement in Carson's numbers, as he saw only nine carries from inside the 5-yard line last year - about half his 2018 total. He needs to stay healthy and prove he's fully recovered from the fractured hip, but more goal-line work would give the fourth-year RB a shot at double-digit touchdowns in addition to his consistent yardage."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0afca88b-83e7-49d6-80df-1f68b21cca9f"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":2,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6156,"away":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"home":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":128.3125,"formatted":"128.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":12.875,"formatted":"12.9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":211.10002,"formatted":"211.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1230.0,"formatted":"1,230"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":37.0,"formatted":"37"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":266.0,"formatted":"266"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.073335,"formatted":"14.07"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":40,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":11,"formatted":"11","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":36,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":16,"formatted":"RB16","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":6.5,"formatted":"6.5"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":14.43,"formatted":"14.43"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.48,"formatted":"13.48"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":211.10002,"formatted":"211.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.073335,"formatted":"14.07"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.5455766,"formatted":"6.55"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":11182,"nameFull":"Todd Gurley","nameShort":"T.

Part of the issue was a Rams offensive line that transitioned from being one of the best units in the league to one of the worst, but Gurley also did less with the opportunities he got as his problematic left knee seemed to take a toll on his explosiveness. Gurley averaged only 1.7 rushing yards after contact, a big step back from 2018 (2.4). His performance was so far below expectations the Rams decided to swallow a huge dead cap hit - $20.15 million, the second most in league history - and release him before he had even played a game under the extension he signed in 2018. He did not take long to find a new home, signing a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Falcons. With Devonta Freeman gone, Gurley will step into the lead role in an Atlanta offense that struggled on the ground last year - Dirk Koetter's offense finished 30th in rushing yards, 26th in yards per carry and last in rushing percentage. A healthier offensive line stocked with first-round draft picks might help, but Gurley's production largely will depend on the condition of his balky knee. To help him stay healthy, the Falcons said they plan to manage his workload, making it unlikely he matches last season's 254 touches."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"externalIds":[{"id":"14263792-d1d3-4b0c-85f7-2a85b4aed6f1"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":2,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6156,"away":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"home":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":133.4375,"formatted":"133.4"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":1.1875,"formatted":"1.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":15.90625,"formatted":"15.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":202.90001,"formatted":"202.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":857.0,"formatted":"857"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":31.0,"formatted":"31"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":207.0,"formatted":"207"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":14.0,"formatted":"14"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.526668,"formatted":"13.53"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":50,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":14,"formatted":"14","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":34,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"RB15","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":9.9,"formatted":"9.9"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":15.33,"formatted":"15.33"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.66,"formatted":"16.66"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":202.90001,"formatted":"202.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.526668,"formatted":"13.53"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.737067,"formatted":"5.74"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12929,"nameFull":"Dalvin Cook","nameShort":"D.

The Florida State product solidified his standing as a three-down weapon, leading the league in carries inside the 5-yard line with 21 while also finishing second to Austin Ekeler in yards per target among running backs (8.2 YPT). Cook's burst through the hole and speed in the open field remain his greatest assets, and his well-rounded skill set keeps him on the field in most situations and makes him arguably the key figure in a Minnesota offense that finished third in the NFL with a 49.1 percent run-play rate. Despite the dynamic numbers, the 5-10, 210-pound Cook still is not completely free of his injury-prone reputation, as the team sat him for the final two games of the regular season while he nursed a shoulder injury, before he scored twice in an upset win over New Orleans in the opening round of the playoffs. With a competent backup available in Alexander Mattison, the Vikings likely will continue to keep a close eye on Cook's workload, and they might even decide to play hardball when it comes to his summer contract holdout.

Thomas maintained his otherworldly catch rate (80.5 percent, second all time only to his 2018 mark) and averaged 9.3 YPT, eighth among the league's 30 100-target WRs, despite playing six games with a backup QB and seeing a massive bump in targets (185, 1st). Thomas' 1,725 receiving yards were also good for seventh in the record book. At 6-3, 212, Thomas has excellent size, runs precise routes and might have the best hands in the league. His rapport with Drew Brees is off the charts, and no player is more reliable at catching short passes and moving the chains. Thomas also led the league in red-zone targets (26) and scored nine times (T-4th), but he doesn't have deep speed (4.57 40) and isn't likely to make the big play - only three catches of 40-plus yards last year and seven in his four-year career. Despite leading the NFL in targets by a wide margin - he had 28 more than No. 2 Julio Jones - Thomas was merely tied for ninth in catches of 20 or more yards (17). Thomas' average depth of target (aDOT) was 8.1 yards (24th), and his 11.6 YPC ranked 23rd among 30 100-target WRs. Bottom line, with Drew Brees set to return in 2020, Thomas is arguably the safest pick on the draft board. He's 27, has missed only one game in his career (in 2016) and relies on short receptions from the NFL's all-time leader in completion percentage."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"externalIds":[{"id":"90c1756d-1f47-41b7-89fe-b113c9850bc1"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":3,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6163,"away":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":198.5,"formatted":"198.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":13.1875,"formatted":"13.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":299.1,"formatted":"299.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":149.0,"formatted":"149"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1725.0,"formatted":"1,725"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":18.69375,"formatted":"18.69"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":6,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":1,"formatted":"1","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":4,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":1,"formatted":"WR1","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":5.7,"formatted":"5.7"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":18.7,"formatted":"18.7"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":17.56,"formatted":"17.56"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":299.1,"formatted":"299.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":18.69375,"formatted":"18.69"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.18205,"formatted":"7.18"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":7372,"nameFull":"Julio Jones","nameShort":"J.

Last year he caught 99 passes, 21 of which went for 20-plus yards (T-3rd) en route to 1,394 receiving yards (2nd) in 15 games, but his usually elite per-play averages took a dip - 8.9 YPT (11th among the league's 30 100-target WR), 14.1 YPC (10th) and only three catches of 40-plus. Jones' odd issue with catching touchdowns resurfaced, after he scored seven during the second half of 2018 and four more in the first three games of last year. He had a two-TD game Week 15 against the Niners but otherwise did not score from Weeks 4-17. In his defense, he received only three inside-the-10 targets and zero inside-the-5 chances over that span - other than in the 49ers game where he had two from inside the 5, converting both. For whatever reason, the Falcons don't look to Jones near the goal line that often, and at 31, he's less likely to provide distance scoring. At 6-3, 220, and running a 4.39 40 at the 2011 combine, Jones is one of the NFL's all-time size/speed freaks. He's probably not as fast as he once was, but he's still an excellent route runner with reliable hands, and it doesn't hurt that he's played with the same competent quarterback for his entire career. Once an injury risk, Jones has missed only four games since 2013. With Mohamed Sanu no longer in the fold and Austin Hooper leaving in free agency, there's no reason to think Jones' target share should diminish much in 2020. Third-year man Calvin Ridley is the only other mouth to feed, and there's plenty to go around in the Falcons' pass-happy offense."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0b3217b9-ba37-4222-95cb-a7a222441e8b"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":3,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6156,"away":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"home":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":155.375,"formatted":"155.4"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":9.93125,"formatted":"9.9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":223.6,"formatted":"223.6"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":99.0,"formatted":"99"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1394.0,"formatted":"1,394"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.906667,"formatted":"14.91"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":31,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":12,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":4,"formatted":"WR4","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.3,"formatted":"11.3"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":21.6,"formatted":"21.6"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.64,"formatted":"16.64"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":223.6,"formatted":"223.6"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.906667,"formatted":"14.91"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.408508,"formatted":"7.41"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":10256,"nameFull":"Sammy Watkins","nameShort":"S.

The fourth overall pick in 2014 put up an 11-9-198-3 line in Week 1, but he didn't crack 80 yards or score a touchdown again until he went 10-7-114-1 in the AFC title game win over the Titans. The flashes of his elite pedigree have always been there, but injuries, inconsistency and adapting to new locations and roles have prevented him from reaching expectations. At 6-1, 211, and with 4.43 speed at the 2014 combine, Watkins has the athleticism and agility of a No. 1 NFL receiver. He's probably lost at least half a step due to injuries, but is still only 27. With Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman around, Watkins won't run many deep routes, and tight end Travis Kelce is Patrick Mahomes' favorite target over the middle. But Watkins will see work in the slot and outside and, after restructuring his deal in April, seems to again be the No. 3 option in the league's best passing game. Just realize his solid volume last year (90 targets in 14 games) came with Hill missing the better part of five games."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"externalIds":[{"id":"7d80b51f-1462-442e-aa7f-8c320a62deed"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":3,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":166.5,"formatted":"166.5"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":10.58125,"formatted":"10.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":111.50001,"formatted":"111.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":52.0,"formatted":"52"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":673.0,"formatted":"673"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":8.576923,"formatted":"8.58"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":129,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":51,"formatted":"51","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":152,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":60,"formatted":"WR60","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.3,"formatted":"1.3"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":4.5,"formatted":"4.5"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":4.1,"formatted":"4.1"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":111.50001,"formatted":"111.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":8.576923,"formatted":"8.58"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":10.12705,"formatted":"10.13"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":11261,"nameFull":"Darren Waller","nameShort":"D.

He doubled his career receiving yardage by Week 3, eventually finishing the season top 3 among tight ends in catches and yards. Waller also tied for second among tight ends in YPT (9.8), while he was sixth in YAC average (6.6) and second in broken tackles (eight). Four years earlier, the sixth-round pick had entered the NFL as an oversized wide receiver before transitioning to tight end in his second season with the Ravens, but he never had much of a chance to develop at the position while serving suspensions for substance abuse violations. Waller has been open about his struggle, pointing to a sober, healthy lifestyle as the spark that eventually led to on-field success. Clearly impressed, the Raiders signed him to a four-year, $29.8 million extension in October, though they also went shopping for depth in the offseason with Jason Witten coming in on a one-year contract. While there's no doubt Waller will be the team's top receiving threat at tight end, he could see his snaps scaled back from last year's 90.3 percent share, with any decrease potentially impacting his target volume. There is also some incoming target competition from other positions, after the Raiders selected Henry Ruggs, Lynn Bowden and Bryan Edwards within the first three rounds of the 2020 draft. The good news is that Waller has shown enough talent and polish to survive as a fantasy asset even if his volume dips."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"externalIds":[{"id":"14c97c9f-26e8-4944-9299-f90de6aeada3"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"min":1,"max":30,"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":46.625,"formatted":"46.6"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":0.25,"formatted":"0.3"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":5.28125,"formatted":"5.3"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":175.99997,"formatted":"176"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":90.0,"formatted":"90"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1145.0,"formatted":"1,145"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.999998,"formatted":"11"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":72,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":58,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":5,"formatted":"TE5","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":13.7,"formatted":"13.7"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":11.87,"formatted":"11.87"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.46,"formatted":"11.46"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":175.99997,"formatted":"176"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.999998,"formatted":"11"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.055681,"formatted":"6.06"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":326,"nameFull":"Philip Rivers","nameShort":"P.

Rivers has a bevy of potential playmakers to target in Indianapolis, including field-stretcher T.Y. Hilton, third-year WR Zach Pascal, a couple second-round picks in Parris Campbell (2019) and Michael Pittman (2020), reliable tight end Jack Doyle, and, in the backfield, 1,000-yard rusher Marlon Mack, scatback Nyheim Hines and second-round rookie Jonathan Taylor. But Rivers' trouble last season wasn't a lack of weapons. The problem was an apparent decline in skills. His career-low 1.15 TD/INT rate was fifth lowest in the league, and his 3.9 TD pass percentage was a career low by far. A league-high nine of his 20 INTs came on throws longer than 20 yards. This year, Rivers will be reunited with Frank Reich, his offensive coordinator in 2014 and 2015 when he averaged 4,539 yards and 30 TDs. But Rivers, who has never missed a game (224 consecutive) since becoming the starter in 2008, isn't likely to approach 600 attempts this year. The Colts ranked fifth in the league last year in rushing percentage (46.4), attempting 513 passes (24th). And don't expect anything from Rivers' legs - he has less than 100 rushing yards the last five years combined - which makes his fantasy upside lower than it's ever been."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e47706c7-e14d-41fb-b13b-83a835a1f3bc"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"min":2,"max":30,"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":255.5,"formatted":"255.5"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":20.56875,"formatted":"20.6"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":230.50002,"formatted":"230.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":65.989845,"formatted":"66.0"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4615.0,"formatted":"4,615"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":23.0,"formatted":"23"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":20.0,"formatted":"20"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.406251,"formatted":"14.41"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":27,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":18,"formatted":"18"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":156,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":25,"formatted":"QB25","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":15.74,"formatted":"15.74"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":11.73,"formatted":"11.73"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":15.07,"formatted":"15.07"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":230.50002,"formatted":"230.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.406251,"formatted":"14.41"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.5312667,"formatted":"5.53"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":5336,"nameFull":"Joe Flacco","nameShort":"J.

With Denver having transitioned to Drew Lock, Flacco waited until late May to find a new home with the Jets. Sam Darnold is locked in as the starter, so Flacco will serve as a mentor and potential fill-in for the third-year pro.

The Chargers have more playmakers than those weapons-poor Bills teams, however, and Taylor, who was noted for good touch on his deep ball, is in his best position to succeed with Keenan Allen and Mike Williams at wideout, 6-5 red-zone target Hunter Henry at tight end and Austin Ekeler, who had 92 receptions out of the backfield last year.

An ankle injury suffered Week 1 cost him the following two games, and while he had a promising stretch after returning - 309 rushing yards and five touchdowns in the next four games - his playing time dwindled late in the season once Raheem Mostert emerged as a dynamic force. Coleman surprised with 105 yards and two scores in a playoff win over the Vikings, but he did little throughout the rest of the postseason. His speed in the open field remains impressive, but the sixth-year back really doesn't bring much else to the table, as defenders have little difficulty getting their hands on him or bringing him down. Coleman's average of 1.4 rushing yards after contact was the fewest in the league, following a poor 1.8 showing in 2018.

Power and burst allow him to hit holes hard, and improved play last season from the interior of Minnesota's offensive line gave the rookie room to run. Mattison didn't add much as a receiver (aside from a strong Week 13 showing against Seattle), but he did show decent hands in college and could be reasonably effective if he were used more often as an outlet option for Kirk Cousins. What Mattison doesn't have is speed or elusiveness to consistently get away from tacklers once he breaks through to the second level, and three of his four longest runs of the year came in the fourth quarter of games where the Vikings held multi-score leads. For a player brought in to provide insurance in case Cook got hurt again, it was also discouraging that Mattison was sidelined at the same time as Cook the final two weeks, opening the door for Mike Boone to make a splash. Cook's summer holdout will place all eyes on the Minnesota backfield, and Mattison in particular, but it could be a committee situation if - and it's still a big \"if\" - Cook ends up skipping games."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"externalIds":[{"id":"ae4faec0-509d-4080-b5cb-d1a44d062858"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":2,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":149.6875,"formatted":"149.7"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":15.03125,"formatted":"15"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":63.399994,"formatted":"63.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":462.0,"formatted":"462"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":82.0,"formatted":"82"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":4.8769226,"formatted":"4.88"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":214,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":58,"formatted":"58","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":118,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":44,"formatted":"RB44","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":7.4,"formatted":"7.4"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.73,"formatted":"5.73"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":4.74,"formatted":"4.74"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":63.399994,"formatted":"63.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":4.8769226,"formatted":"4.88"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.3252313,"formatted":"3.33"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":14471,"nameFull":"Jeffery Wilson","nameShort":"J.

With both backs still under contract and Jerick McKinnon at the top of the depth chart, Wilson's role in San Francisco is uncertain now that he can no longer be stashed on the practice squad."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"72cf3127-3953-4fd8-8049-3de1b6fa9825"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":2,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":148.3125,"formatted":"148.3"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.8125,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":14.0875,"formatted":"14.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":45.4,"formatted":"45.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":105.0,"formatted":"105"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":34.0,"formatted":"34"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":5.675,"formatted":"5.68"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":258,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":74,"formatted":"74","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":293,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":102,"formatted":"RB102","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":4.3,"formatted":"4.3"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":2.84,"formatted":"2.84"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":45.4,"formatted":"45.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":5.675,"formatted":"5.68"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.7503796,"formatted":"5.75"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14018,"nameFull":"Justin Jackson","nameShort":"J.

A seventh-round pick in 2018, the Northwestern product has the elusiveness and balance in traffic to break through to the second level with regularity, and despite his limited workload in the NFL he's been a big-play threat on the ground, gaining at least 20 yards on three of his 29 carries last year. He's worked hard to bring his receiving skills up to average, but his thin frame (6-0, 199) isn't an advantage in pass protection.

His college tape from Memphis shows speed and burst that make him seem capable of breaking off a big gain every time he gets the ball, and he also displayed receiving skills that hint at three-down potential. Henderson struggled to pick up the playbook in the preseason, however, and while he wasn't expected to see a large role behind a healthy Todd Gurley, he didn't even see double-digit snaps until Week 6 and barely saw the field at all after Week 8. Gurley's now in Atlanta, though, replaced by 2020 second-round pick Cam Akers. The Rams figure to have a competition for backfield roles, with veteran and longtime Gurley backup Malcolm Brown also in the mix. Brown and Henderson have the benefit of scheme familiarity, while Akers has the advantages of draft capital, prototypical size (5-10, 217) and experience handling a three-down role at FSU. That's not to say Henderson is out of the running for the lead role, but he's more likely to end up second or third in a committee."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"externalIds":[{"id":"380c4d9b-d4c8-456c-ba50-25519edde899"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":2,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":126.25,"formatted":"126.2"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.8125,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":13.5625,"formatted":"13.6"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":20.400002,"formatted":"20.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":147.0,"formatted":"147"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":37.0,"formatted":"37"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"formatted":"0"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":2.266667,"formatted":"2.27"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":348,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":96,"formatted":"96","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":128,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":46,"formatted":"RB46","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":0.7,"formatted":"0.7"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":0.23,"formatted":"0.23"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":0.56,"formatted":"0.56"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":20.400002,"formatted":"20.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":2.266667,"formatted":"2.27"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":2.7317066,"formatted":"2.73"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14881,"nameFull":"Kerrith Whyte","nameShort":"K.

He is not a premium athletic specimen, but Perine showed good patience and vision in waiting for holes to develop, and the power and balance to get through them to the second level. In some ways, he is a bargain-bin version of Le'Veon Bell, but as the real deal demonstrated last season, coach Adam Gase's offensive scheme might not be a great fit for that particular skill set.

The per-play averages (...","description":"Age, a history of concussions and a declining Tom Brady couldn't stop Edelman from getting his in 2019. The per-play averages (11.2 YPC, 7.3 YPT) during his age-33 season were in line with his career marks on massive volume (153 targets, 100 catches). But the difficulty bar went up a notch this offseason, with Edelman turning 34 in May and Brady heading to Tampa Bay. Until late June, it looked like Edelman would be catching passes from Jarrett Stidham, but the addition of 2015 NFL MVP Cam Newton could give the New England offense a jolt of upside. Edelman runs short routes that are easy for any quarterback to complete, but the rapport he enjoyed with Brady could be lacking and the unprecedented nature of this offseason may slow his connection with Newton. At 5-10, 198, Edelman is small but stout, and his average speed and above-average quickness have likely declined. No one can question his toughness, but he's also dropped too many passes - 19 the last two years. He'll likely return as the team's top option, mostly due to lack of competition. Second-year man N'Keal Harry could develop if he stays healthy, and veteran Mohamed Sanu is also around, but neither is established in the Patriots' system."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"externalIds":[{"id":"2bb70d56-a79a-4fa1-ae37-99858a3ffd55"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"min":4,"max":30,"start":3,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":176.5625,"formatted":"176.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":1.6875,"formatted":"1.7"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":12.528125,"formatted":"12.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":204.28,"formatted":"204.28"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":100.0,"formatted":"100"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1117.0,"formatted":"1,117"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.7675,"formatted":"12.77"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":49,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":11,"formatted":"11","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":73,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":33,"formatted":"WR33"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":3.1,"formatted":"3.1"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.57,"formatted":"5.57"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":11.18,"formatted":"11.18"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":204.28,"formatted":"204.28"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.7675,"formatted":"12.77"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.244045,"formatted":"6.24"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12353,"nameFull":"Geronimo Allison","nameShort":"G.

He turned 32 in July, but at 5-10, 185, and with a history of durability and plenty of time away, his skills could be largely intact.

Green was efficient too - 9.0 YPT (10th had he qualified) and 15.1 YPC (6th). At 6-4, 210, and with 4.48 speed, Green had been the Bengals' top dog since he was drafted fourth overall in 2011. He's now 32 and coming off a lost year, following one in which he didn't have a single catch for 40-plus yards. Green is past his peak, and it's unclear how he'll mesh with the other talent on the roster, namely uber-QB-prospect Joe Burrow, co-No. 1 Tyler Boyd and the team's other wideouts - John Ross, Auden Tate and rookie second-round pick Tee Higgins.

In nay case, he'll be the leading tight end in a rotation along with Jordan Thomas, Jordan Akins and Kahale Warring."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"54d4e35a-2e6c-48f6-86ad-92dd596c173c"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"min":1,"max":30,"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":59.625,"formatted":"59.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":0.3125,"formatted":"0.3"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":5.675,"formatted":"5.7"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":93.1,"formatted":"93.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":34.0,"formatted":"34"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":341.0,"formatted":"341"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":6.2066665,"formatted":"6.21"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":153,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"15"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":260,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":36,"formatted":"TE36","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":4.2,"formatted":"4.2"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":2.03,"formatted":"2.03"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":3.66,"formatted":"3.66"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":93.1,"formatted":"93.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":6.2066665,"formatted":"6.21"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.995716,"formatted":"6"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":10991,"nameFull":"Cameron Brate","nameShort":"C.

The addition of Brady's legendary battery mate Rob Gronkowski this offseason and the fact O.J. Howard remained on the roster following the draft seemingly dampen Brate's prospects. However, the veteran's reliable hands and knack for the end zone could render him a tailor-made favorite for a quarterback who boasts a long track record of success targeting tight ends. Brate has consistently been a red-zone force throughout his six-year career, crossing the goal line on 27 of his 195 catches over that span. Moreover, Brate has a 75.0 percent touchdown conversion rate on his red-zone touches over both of the last two seasons, so despite the uphill battle for targets in a loaded Buccaneers passing game, he could carve out a modest but consistent role if he earns Brady's trust."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"5afe93fd-0caf-4cca-83fc-7f405bebfa3e"}]},"eligibleFor":[{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"min":1,"max":30,"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"QB/RB/WR/TE","group":"START","eligibility":["QB","RB","WR","TE"],"start":1,"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED","DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN","DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE","DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},{"label":"BN","max":31}],"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6163,"away":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":48.25,"formatted":"48.2"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":0.3125,"formatted":"0.3"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":6.1625,"formatted":"6.2"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":73.1,"formatted":"73.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":36.0,"formatted":"36"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":311.0,"formatted":"311"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"drop":true,"trade":true}},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":5.2214284,"formatted":"5.22"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1387320,"name":"Antonio Brown Can Go Yuck Fimself"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":190,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":24,"formatted":"24"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":253,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":35,"formatted":"TE35","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":6.7,"formatted":"6.7"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":4.73,"formatted":"4.73"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":5.24,"formatted":"5.24"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":73.1,"formatted":"73.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":5.2214284,"formatted":"5.22"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":4.323553,"formatted":"4.32"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14475,"nameFull":"Will Dissly","nameShort":"W.

In 2018, he came in as a fourth-round pick and put up 151 yards and two TDs over his first three games before suffering a torn patellar tendon Week 4. It's one of the worst injuries a football player can have, yet Dissly made it back for Week 1 last season and immediately reclaimed the starting job. Sitting on 262 yards and four TDs through five games, he had worked his way into a three-down role and earned Russell Wilson's trust in the red zone (five targets). Then Week 6 brought a torn Achilles. While the Seahawks claim they're optimistic the 24-year-old will be ready for Week 1, their offseason moves - signing Greg Olsen, drafting Colby Parkinson in the fourth round, giving Jacob Hollister a second-round RFA tender - hint at some level of doubt.

That's what 600-plus attempts will do for you, especially when you lead the league in completions (408). While his bad-pass percentage was virtually unchanged from the previous season (16.4, fifth lowest), Ryan's interception rate jumped to 2.3 percent (20th) thanks to five picks on attempts longer than 20 yards (he had one interception on deep passes in 2018). Ryan's efficiency also back-slid, his YPA a six-year-low 7.3 (after 8.1 the previous season), as he faced a barrage of pressure - a league-high-tying 48 sacks. Injuries played a big role in that futility, and this year's O-line returns all five starters healthy. Not returning is tight end Austin Hooper and his 97 targets, but the Falcons replaced him with Hayden Hurst via trade. All-world wide receiver Julio Jones is back, as is Calvin Ridley, who missed the final three games of last season with an abdominal injury. The Falcons let Devonta Freeman walk, instead signing Todd Gurley and his bad knee to a low-risk, one-year contract. Gurley's workload will be managed, and he's not likely to get significantly more than the 184 rushes Freeman had last year, which means penciling in Ryan for another 600 attempts seems safe.

Bridgewater went 5-0 starting for an injured Brees last season, completing 69.7 percent of his passes in those games with nine TDs and two interceptions. Like his mentor, he benefited from a short passing game that emphasized quick slants and the like, rarely asking him to challenge defenses deep - just 13 passes longer than 20 yards, 6.6 percent of his 196 attempts. Bridgewater's bad-pass percentage was 14.3, third lowest in the league among QBs with at least 175 attempts (Brees was first at 14.0), but his average depth of target was a mere 6.0 yards, lowest in the NFL. The Panthers are sure to ask more of Bridgewater, especially considering their weapons. Third-year WR D.J. Moore is coming off a breakout season, Curtis Samuel has 4.31 speed and the team signed another speedy wideout in Robby Anderson. And then, of course, there's Christian McCaffrey out of the backfield. Bridgewater will be reunited with Joe Brady, Carolina's offensive coordinator who was an offensive assistant in New Orleans in 2018. Last season, Brady was the passing game coordinator for national collegiate champion LSU, which no one would confuse with a dink-and-dunk offense. And new head coach Matt Rhule remade an offensive line that gave up a league-high 58 sacks last year, acquiring Russell Okung, John Miller and Michael Schofield, upgrades all. Bridgewater better warm up his arm."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"d4cb52a9-f6b4-42ed-b40b-27bff5f1eea7"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":272.1875,"formatted":"272.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":2.0625,"formatted":"2.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":24.534374,"formatted":"24.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":89.46001,"formatted":"89.46"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":67.85714,"formatted":"67.9"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":1384.0,"formatted":"1,384"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.940001,"formatted":"9.94"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":160,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":33,"formatted":"33","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":163,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":26,"formatted":"QB26","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":0.26,"formatted":"0.26"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":-0.08,"formatted":"-0.08"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":6.66,"formatted":"6.66"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":89.46001,"formatted":"89.46"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.940001,"formatted":"9.94"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.317816,"formatted":"9.32"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13111,"nameFull":"Aaron Jones","nameShort":"A.

At 5-9, 208, Jones doesn't have truly elite traits as a runner, but his power, speed and balance are above average and allow him to survive first contact and keep going. Last year, Jones ranked second in broken tackle rate (one for every 7.4 carries), a huge increase from 2018 (41st, one for every 22.2 carries). He's also become an asset as a receiver, setting career highs in targets, catches and receiving yards last year, with his 7.0 YPT ranking fifth among 19 running backs with at least 50 targets. With Aaron Rodgers still efficient but slipping into the twilight of his career, Matt LaFleur's offense will continue to find ways to get the ball out of the quarterback's hand quickly while also prioritizing the run game. Jones remains the clear centerpiece of that rushing attack, but the Packers also seem to be fond of Jamaal Williams, and they just used a second-round pick on 247-pound bruiser AJ Dillon. Already a leading candidate for negative TD regression, Jones could take an especially huge hit if Dillon gets some of the goal-line carries."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"27dd5b6e-ea65-4622-a6b4-460fd144407c"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":135.6875,"formatted":"135.7"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":11.925,"formatted":"11.9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":289.3,"formatted":"289.3"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1084.0,"formatted":"1,084"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":49.0,"formatted":"49"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":474.0,"formatted":"474"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":19.0,"formatted":"19"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":18.08125,"formatted":"18.08"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":8,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":20,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":11,"formatted":"RB11","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":15.3,"formatted":"15.3"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":19.8,"formatted":"19.8"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":18.54,"formatted":"18.54"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":289.3,"formatted":"289.3"},"seasonAverage":{"value":18.08125,"formatted":"18.08"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":12.342924,"formatted":"12.34"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12042,"nameFull":"Derrick Henry","nameShort":"D.

He edged Nick Chubb for the rushing crown thanks both to a league-high 303 carries and 5.1 YPC, while also tying Aaron Jones for the league lead with 16 rushing touchdowns. At a beastly 6-3, 247, Henry is nearly impossible to bring down once he gets a head of steam - he tied for third in the NFL with 29 broken tackles (emphasis on the \"broken\") while ranking second with an average of 3.2 yards after contact. The Titans remain reluctant to use him much in the passing game, putting a ceiling on his overall fantasy production, but he continues to show some ability as a receiver, and there may be no more terrifying situation for a cornerback than seeing Henry get the ball in the flat and realizing you're all that stands between him and the end zone. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill thrived with the play-action opportunities Henry helped to create, and it is unlikely offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will add too many wrinkles to a formula that worked so brilliantly in the second half of last season. Henry even signed his franchise-tag tender this offseason, essentially removing the possibility of a holdout.

He missed two games due to the gimpy knee and then three more in the second half with a rib injury, and in between he had only a meager two-week stretch in which he looked like the player who'd won the starting job the year before. As he had the previous season, Williams came up big when it mattered most. In his final five games, including the Chiefs' three-game playoff run, Williams averaged 107.2 yards and scored nine touchdowns, racking up 133 yards and two scores against a formidable 49ers defense in Super Bowl LIV. The Oklahoma product is an excellent receiver who uses surprising balance and footwork to bounce off defenders. He finished last season third in broken-tackle rate and first in after-contact average (3.2), albeit with barely enough carries to qualify (and after breaking only two tackles on 73 regular-season touches in 2018). Perhaps the Chiefs think the newfound elusiveness is a small-sample fluke, considering they drafted Clyde Edwards-Helaire with the 32nd pick in this year's draft. The rookie handled a three-down role at LSU last season, piling up 1,867 yards and 17 touchdowns from 215 carries (6.6 YPC) and 55 receptions (8.2 YPR) in a pass-heavy offense. The nature of his role in Baton Rouge should make for a smooth transition to a similarly aggressive offense in Kansas City, but that doesn't necessarily mean Edwards-Helaire will replace Williams as the starter before Week 1."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"externalIds":[{"id":"90908a56-901b-466d-8689-943075da96fe"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":152.8125,"formatted":"152.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.0625,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":15.61875,"formatted":"15.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":126.10001,"formatted":"126.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":498.0,"formatted":"498"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":30.0,"formatted":"30"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":213.0,"formatted":"213"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.463637,"formatted":"11.46"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":115,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":35,"formatted":"35"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":89,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":33,"formatted":"RB33"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":29.4,"formatted":"29.4"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":15.97,"formatted":"15.97"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":15.82,"formatted":"15.82"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":126.10001,"formatted":"126.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.463637,"formatted":"11.46"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.9628973,"formatted":"7.96"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":10243,"nameFull":"Odell Beckham","nameShort":"O.

It didn't help that the team and offense were dysfunctional, and the quarterback play surprisingly subpar. Beckham's per-play numbers were pedestrian as a result - 7.8 YPT, only three catches of 40-plus yards on 133 targets, and four touchdowns. Despite his one-handed catching ability, vertical leap and body control, Beckham saw only 14 red-zone looks, and only five of those were from inside the five. At 5-11, 198, Beckham has average size, and his timed combine speed (4.43) was good but nothing special. Beckham seems to play faster in pads, and when healthy has been one of the most dangerous open-field runners in the league. He's expected to be completely healthy for the start of training camp, and he's still only 27, but given his multi-year health issues, quarterback Baker Mayfield's struggles behind a weak offensive line and bad management from the GM down, there's plenty of risk to match the enormous upside. One bright spot is new coach Kevin Stefanski taking over for Freddie Kitchens. Last year's offensive coordinator in Minnesota, Stefanski is likely to bring a Kyle Shanahan-style rushing offense to Cleveland, which, if successful, could generate more downfield looks to Beckham off play-action. While he could have more competition for targets - Jarvis Landry will be back, Kareem Hunt is around for a full season and new tight end Austin Hooper will see work - a healthy Beckham should still be the primary playmaker and top dog."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"354dec38-b88b-4ba0-8974-859123f27c45"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":159.625,"formatted":"159.6"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":8.75,"formatted":"8.7"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":164.3,"formatted":"164.3"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":74.0,"formatted":"74"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1035.0,"formatted":"1,035"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.26875,"formatted":"10.27"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":81,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":26,"formatted":"26"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":28,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":10,"formatted":"WR10","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":15.6,"formatted":"15.6"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":12.87,"formatted":"12.87"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.58,"formatted":"9.58"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":164.3,"formatted":"164.3"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.26875,"formatted":"10.27"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.5137014,"formatted":"5.51"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":8735,"nameFull":"Cole Beasley","nameShort":"C.

His per-play averages were nothing special, but chain-movers like Beasley rarely run downfield routes. At 5-8, 174, Beasley is small, and he's quick in and out of his breaks, with enough speed - 4.49 40 at the 2012 combine - to gain yards after the catch if he makes someone miss, though he doesn't break many tackles. The biggest issue for Beasley this year is the arrival of Stefon Diggs, a bigger, faster, quicker receiver who can also line up in the slot on occasion. It's likely deep threat John Brown, Diggs and Beasley will often be on the field together, but Beasley is the least talented of the three and probably will reprise a smaller version of last year's role."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"externalIds":[{"id":"7092bb09-a161-4ab9-8d19-fdcf1a91bb3d"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6155,"away":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":161.125,"formatted":"161.1"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":1.25,"formatted":"1.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":10.371875,"formatted":"10.4"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":151.3,"formatted":"151.3"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":67.0,"formatted":"67"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":778.0,"formatted":"778"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.086667,"formatted":"10.09"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":94,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":34,"formatted":"34"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":191,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":75,"formatted":"WR75","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":14.3,"formatted":"14.3"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.43,"formatted":"9.43"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":12.98,"formatted":"12.98"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":151.3,"formatted":"151.3"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.086667,"formatted":"10.09"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":4.681575,"formatted":"4.68"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14836,"nameFull":"Hunter Renfrow","nameShort":"H.

Heading into his sixth NFL season, however, he could be facing his best opportunity yet to prove he can handle being a lead back. At 5-10, 210, Johnson is a smaller back who runs with surprising power in addition to his top-shelf receiving skills and elusiveness in the open field. Johnson has averaged at least 4.9 yards per carry in three of the last four seasons, and his 2019 average of 2.8 yards after contact per carry put him in the company of players like Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs. But pass-catching remains his bread and butter, and Johnson's 44-410-3 line on 62 targets in his first season with Houston was actually the lowest output of his career. Carlos Hyde, last year's lead back, was not re-signed, instead replaced by David Johnson. And given the steep price coach Bill O'Brien paid to get him, the newer Johnson seems assured of a shot at the top spot in the backfield despite his mediocre recent numbers in Arizona. David has also missed 18 games in the last three seasons, while Duke has yet to miss a game in his career. If the new guy breaks down, Duke could finally get his chance to be the king."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"31c376b7-2e10-473a-aa54-d9f709a5b93e"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":167.9375,"formatted":"167.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":0.9375,"formatted":"0.9"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":15.559375,"formatted":"15.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":132.0,"formatted":"132"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":410.0,"formatted":"410"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":44.0,"formatted":"44"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":410.0,"formatted":"410"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":8.25,"formatted":"8.25"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":108,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":31,"formatted":"31"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":138,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":48,"formatted":"RB48","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":14.2,"formatted":"14.2"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.87,"formatted":"5.87"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":8.52,"formatted":"8.52"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":132.0,"formatted":"132"},"seasonAverage":{"value":8.25,"formatted":"8.25"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.0108633,"formatted":"5.01"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13040,"nameFull":"Jamaal Williams","nameShort":"J.

After beginning the season serving the remainder of his 2018 suspension, the former Chief joined the Cleveland backfield in Week 10 and immediately was thrust into a significant role, seeing 34 to 45 offensive snaps in every game. While his overall touches were firmly capped working behind Nick Chubb, Hunt saw plenty of action on passing downs while also proving useful on the ground, and the traits that won him a rushing title in 2017 were still evident. Hunt's elite elusiveness and balance helped him average 2.7 yards after contact on 43 carries and 7.5 yards after the catch on his 37 receptions. With Chubb entrenched atop the depth chart and not showing any particular susceptibility to injury in his NFL career, Hunt's role doesn't seem likely to increase much, but better overall performance from a Cleveland offense that was a disappointment in 2019 could lead to more production to go around."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0ef0d0ca-2d2d-455b-ab63-a20c01303e37"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":110.1875,"formatted":"110.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":12.85625,"formatted":"12.9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":81.899994,"formatted":"81.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":179.0,"formatted":"179"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":37.0,"formatted":"37"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":285.0,"formatted":"285"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.237499,"formatted":"10.24"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":173,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":49,"formatted":"49","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":78,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":29,"formatted":"RB29"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":5.1,"formatted":"5.1"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":7.6,"formatted":"7.6"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.32,"formatted":"10.32"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":81.899994,"formatted":"81.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.237499,"formatted":"10.24"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.2283685,"formatted":"3.23"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13935,"nameFull":"Jaylen Samuels","nameShort":"J.

At least the latter category is not all negative, for while teams always seem willing to part with him, there's another that's willing to give up something of value to acquire him. In this case it was the Texans who gave up a second-rounder for a fourth-rounder and took on $8 million of Cooks' salary, meaning he should be a prominent part of their plans. The issue is they already have two deep threats in Kenny Stills and Will Fuller, plus a newly signed slot receiver in Randall Cobb. At 5-10, 183, Cooks is small and slight, but very fast - 4.33 40 - and also quick. He can line up in the slot or as an outside deep threat and had put up four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons before last year's concussion-plagued campaign. Cooks is still only 26, so he probably hasn't lost anything physically, and Deshaun Watson is yet another star quarterback with whom he's now paired.

In the end, Harry had only 24 targets for a paltry 8.8 YPC and 4.4 YPT. The good news is he'll almost certainly have a bigger role this year. With Tom Brady gone, the team's quarterback situation is evolving, but Harry won't have as steep a hill to climb to earn  the trust of either Cam Newton or Jarrett Stidham. At 6-4, 225, Harry is massive, and while he has only average speed for his size (4.53 40), he's strong, physical and athletic. As the team's first-round pick in 2019, Harry will likely be next in line after Julian Edelman to see regular opportunities, though veteran holdover Mohamed Sanu is also still around. And Edelman will turn 34 in May, so this could be a passing-of-the-torch year, with Harry taking over as the top dog for the franchise.

His 525 rookie-year snaps yielded 33 catches and four TDs, instantly make the South Dakota State product one of the better No. 2 tight ends in the league. Goedert kicked it up a notch last year in his sophomore season, with Philadelphia's disastrous situation at wide receiver allowing him to jump up to 781 snaps (70.9 percent), eighth most among tight ends. The Eagles became a two-TE base offense, utilizing 12 personnel on a league-high 52 percent of snaps, including 66 percent after a Week 10 bye. Goedert nearly doubled his target total from the previous season, but his YPT dipped by six-tenths of a yard and he scored just one more TD than he had as a rookie. Zach Ertz also suffered a big efficiency drop, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing for either tight end to see the Eagles deploy their draft capital toward some receivers who can actually draw safeties away from the middle of the field. On the other hand, superior WR personnel could shift the Eagles back toward more three-wide formations, which in turn would cost Goedert snaps and routes. His solid blocking gives him a reasonable case to poach playing time in single-TE sets, but it isn't clear if the Eagles would seriously consider taking Ertz off the field for more than a handful of plays per game."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e8029983-87cf-49a2-bc04-04c8233a0630"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6157,"away":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"home":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":54.875,"formatted":"54.9"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":0.5625,"formatted":"0.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":6.78125,"formatted":"6.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":115.7,"formatted":"115.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":58.0,"formatted":"58"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":607.0,"formatted":"607"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":7.713333,"formatted":"7.71"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":127,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":10,"formatted":"10","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":136,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":17,"formatted":"TE17"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.5,"formatted":"8.5"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":12.03,"formatted":"12.03"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":10.26,"formatted":"10.26"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":115.7,"formatted":"115.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":7.713333,"formatted":"7.71"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":4.681007,"formatted":"4.68"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":9384,"nameFull":"Vance McDonald","nameShort":"V.

Still, after combining for 33 receptions across the last two campaigns, Firkser will need a significant increase in targets to produce at a notable level."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"b0719e3d-199b-46e5-a2b4-1091f6fd5c0d"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":60.875,"formatted":"60.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":0.1875,"formatted":"0.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":5.375,"formatted":"5.4"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":33.4,"formatted":"33.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":14.0,"formatted":"14"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":204.0,"formatted":"204"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":3.3400002,"formatted":"3.34"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388291,"name":"Picks > Winz","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388291_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":294,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":48,"formatted":"48","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":0.73,"formatted":"0.73"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":2.06,"formatted":"2.06"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":33.4,"formatted":"33.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":3.3400002,"formatted":"3.34"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.1626573,"formatted":"3.16"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":10353,"nameFull":"Logan Thomas","nameShort":"L.

Upon Njoku's return, Kitchens questioned his effort and made the 23-year-old a healthy scratch. With a new head coach in Kevin Stefanski, one who utilizes tight ends, Njoku's fantasy outlook takes on a slightly more positive feel. However, the team spent big money to bring in Austin Hooper, likely leaving Njoku as the No. 2 TE.

His completion percentage dropped by nearly six points (69.6 to 63.9) from the year prior, and his YPA was a full yard less, ranking 26th at 6.7, but he played 16 games for the first time since his rookie season and finished with a QB10 fantasy ranking. Wentz had to deal with a receiving corps that was decimated by injuries, which impacted his downfield passing. Just 10.3 percent of his attempts traveled longer than 20 yards (19th), and he completed only 30.2 percent (23rd) for a 9.8 YPA (25th) with five interceptions (fourth most). The Eagles made improving their downfield attack an offseason priority, adding speed wherever they could: first-round draft pick Jalen Reagor (4.47 40), fifth-rounder John Hightower (4.43), sixth-rounder Quez Watkins (4.35) and Marquise Goodwin (4.27) via a draft-day trade. DeSean Jackson also is healthy after season-ending core muscle surgery. Stretching the field theoretically should give Wentz more open looks underneath to the team's tight ends, Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert. And Wentz loves his tight ends in the red zone - 27 targets last season, tied for the most by a TE duo. Wentz's red-zone TD pass percentage was 27.5 (8th), but he's been highly efficient in the red zone three years running, so perhaps regression is not imminent. The Eagles drafted quarterback Jalen Hurts in the second round, but he's no threat to Wentz, whose rushing ability adds to his fantasy value."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e9a5c16b-4472-4be9-8030-3f77be7890cb"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6157,"away":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"home":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":255.8125,"formatted":"255.8"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":2.1875,"formatted":"2.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":23.1,"formatted":"23.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":266.86,"formatted":"266.86"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":63.92092,"formatted":"63.9"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4039.0,"formatted":"4,039"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":27.0,"formatted":"27"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":16.67875,"formatted":"16.68"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":15,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":10,"formatted":"10"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":83,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":9,"formatted":"QB9","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":16.06,"formatted":"16.06"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":17.85,"formatted":"17.85"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":19.17,"formatted":"19.17"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":266.86,"formatted":"266.86"},"seasonAverage":{"value":16.67875,"formatted":"16.68"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.104251,"formatted":"5.1"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":3452,"nameFull":"Aaron Rodgers","nameShort":"A.

But for Rodgers, his first season under coach Matt LaFleur looked a lot like his final season under coach Mike McCarthy. Rodgers again was stymied by a wideout corps that had no playmakers beyond Davante Adams, who missed four games and still sucked up nearly 24 percent of the team's targets and nearly 25 percent of the receiving yards. Rodgers improved his bad-pass percentage to 19.3  (12th) but did not get much help from his receivers, who dropped 6.2 percent of his targets (5th most). For the second year in a row, Rodgers had to simply throw away too many passes because his teammates were not open; his 31 throwaways were second most in the league. That helped him lead the league in interception rate at 0.7 percent, but it also hurt his TD pass percentage, which at 4.6 was the lowest of his career save for 2018's 4.2 percent. Rodgers still goes downfield at a good clip - 15.1 percent of his passes went beyond 20 yards, third highest in the league - but his 29.1 completion percentage was a career low on downfield attempts. He finished the year QB9 in fantasy, but that seems like his ceiling unless his attempts spike to 600 (unlikely) or he gets additional playmakers before Week 1. The team surprisingly did not draft a wide receiver from a stacked rookie class, instead using its first-round pick on potential quarterback heir Jordan Love, followed by a second-round pick spent on running back AJ Dillon. The biggest pass-catching addition this offseason was Devin Funchess, who missed nearly all last season with a broken collarbone. Given the circumstances, it seemingly will be tough for Rodgers to return to the top 10 of fantasy quarterbacks."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0ce48193-e2fa-466e-a986-33f751add206"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":253.8125,"formatted":"253.8"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":1.4375,"formatted":"1.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":18.071875,"formatted":"18.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":278.38,"formatted":"278.38"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":62.038666,"formatted":"62.0"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4002.0,"formatted":"4,002"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":26.0,"formatted":"26"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":17.39875,"formatted":"17.4"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":14,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":9,"formatted":"9","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":95,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":12,"formatted":"QB12"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":19.02,"formatted":"19.02"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":13.93,"formatted":"13.93"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.26,"formatted":"16.26"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":278.38,"formatted":"278.38"},"seasonAverage":{"value":17.39875,"formatted":"17.4"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.174629,"formatted":"9.17"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12951,"nameFull":"James Conner","nameShort":"J.

The Pitt product struggled out of the gate, but he seemed to have found his rhythm by Week 4, piling up 449 yards from scrimmage and five touchdowns over the next four games. A shoulder injury suffered in Week 8, and then a quad strain in Week 16, ruined his second half, and Conner managed to suit up for only 56 snaps in the Steelers' final nine games. When he's healthy, Conner combines a rugged, physical running style with strong receiving skills, but that accumulation of violent contact took its toll last year, and even when he was in the lineup he wasn't as effective as he had been the year before, dropping to 34th in yards per carry and 43rd in broken tackle rate.

While a nagging ankle injury kept him from fully participating at the combine, his workouts as an 18-year-old coming out of high school were eye-popping (he ran a 4.45 40, and his 43.1-inch vertical would have been second highest by a college RB since 2006). He also flashed plenty of breakaway speed at Ohio State, leading the nation last season with 31 runs of 15-plus yards. Dobbins even showed some ability as a receiver and pass protector, cementing his status as a potential three-down option in the NFL. This season, he'll likely be part of a backfield committee for Baltimore, which drafted him 55th overall. The Ravens led the league with 596 rush attempts last season and set a NFL record with 3,296 rushing yards, but it was quarterback Lamar Jackson who led the way with 37 percent of the yardage and a third of the touchdowns, leaving Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill with a combined 393 carries for 1,954 yards and 14 TDs.

His per-play averages were subpar - 11.7 YPC (19th) and 7.4 YPT (23rd), i.e., he was a far cry from the explosive player who broke out for 1,400 yards and 14 TDs as a 21-year-old with Blake Bortles under center in 2015. In Robinson's defense, he played in the least efficient passing offense in the league (6.2 YPA), and even with Mitch Trubisky slated to return in 2020, the Chicago aerial attack should be better through simple regression to the mean. (And newly acquired Nick Foles could even be an upgrade if it comes to that.) At 6-2, 220, and with 4.48 speed at his 2014 pro day, Robinson is big, fast and agile. He had only one catch of 40-plus yards and a modest 15 of 20-plus (T-16th), but he was used extensively in the red zone - 20 looks inside the 20 (T-7th) and 11 targets from inside the 10 (T-2nd). Robinson's ceiling depends on Trubisky's continued development or a Foles takeover, but a frequent target with red-zone skills has a nice floor no matter who's under center. Anthony Miller showed progress late last year, but otherwise the wide receiver depth chart is thin, and the passing-game tree surprisingly narrow."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0fd32417-8410-4a8f-8919-386c433bca43"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6160,"away":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":190.875,"formatted":"190.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":11.028125,"formatted":"11"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":205.90001,"formatted":"205.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":98.0,"formatted":"98"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1147.0,"formatted":"1,147"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.868751,"formatted":"12.87"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":46,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":10,"formatted":"10","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":29,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":11,"formatted":"WR11","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.8,"formatted":"11.8"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":12.03,"formatted":"12.03"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":14.8,"formatted":"14.8"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":205.90001,"formatted":"205.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.868751,"formatted":"12.87"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.6119866,"formatted":"6.61"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12890,"nameFull":"Mike Williams","nameShort":"M.

Chalk it up mostly to bad luck. Williams had roughly the same number of red-zone and goal-line targets both seasons, dropped only three passes all year and tied for the league lead with a whopping eight catches for 40-plus yards. In other words, he had adequate red-zone looks, a ton of big plays and only two TDs to show for it. Williams was also efficient. He led all 85-target receivers with 20.4 YPC, and was second to A.J. Brown with 11.2 YPT. At 6-4, 220, and with a giant wingspan, Williams doesn't need to be open to make a play, and his 4.49 wheels allow him to get downfield. With Philip Rivers gone, the Chargers apparently will roll with Tyrod Taylor at QB, though they drafted Justin Herbert sixth overall. Either way, it probably means fewer overall passes and not as many downfield throws. But Williams is one of the NFL's more physically gifted WRs, and the 2017 seventh overall pick should continue to increase his share in the passing game relative to Rivers-favorite Keenan Allen. At the least, expect a bounce back in TDs. Williams acknowledged after the season he played on a sore knee, but exams showed no major damage, and he's expected to be healthy for 2020."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"12f27311-7cd6-4ca5-ba7d-571e9de5e1eb"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":164.125,"formatted":"164.1"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":9.403125,"formatted":"9.4"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":136.8,"formatted":"136.8"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":49.0,"formatted":"49"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1001.0,"formatted":"1,001"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.12,"formatted":"9.12"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":104,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":38,"formatted":"38"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":92,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":38,"formatted":"WR38"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":4.8,"formatted":"4.8"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":8.83,"formatted":"8.83"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.8,"formatted":"10.8"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":136.8,"formatted":"136.8"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.12,"formatted":"9.12"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.371688,"formatted":"3.37"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":11329,"nameFull":"Stefon Diggs","nameShort":"S.

Moreover, despite only 94 targets, Diggs tied for the league lead with eight catches of 40-plus yards and was tied for sixth with 20 catches of 20-plus.

At 6-0, 191, Diggs has just average size, and his 4.46 timed speed is good but nothing special. Diggs made his living on quickness, crisp route running, reliable hands and torching the Eagles' sorry secondary in Week 6. The Vikings traded Diggs to Buffalo this offseason, so he'll ply his trade with the strong-armed but less accurate Josh Allen. The Bills were tied for 25th with only 513 passing attempts last year, and they already have a quality deep threat in John Brown, so Diggs might transition back to being an intermediate target.

So, there's reason for some optimism heading into this season. But with a new coach in Ron Rivera and new offensive coordinator in Scott Turner, Haskins has to learn a new system for the second year in a row. On top of that, the Redskins' offensive line is mediocre, and outside of his former Ohio State teammate Terry McLaurin, who impressed as a rookie last year, the offense is largely devoid of playmakers. The Redskins also traded for Kyle Allen, who started 12 games for Rivera's Panthers last season, giving Haskins competition for the job. Haskins showed last year he has a strong arm, and he was highly accurate at Ohio State, but he only played one year in college and is still learning the position.

It's fair to say that coaching changes and poor protection have hindered Rosen's development throughout his short career, and the former No. 10 overall pick could still have a chance to succeed in the NFL, but Tua Tagovailoa's presence in Miami could now make the former UCLA star the odd man out in the quarterback room."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"5c079a21-ae9e-4b38-a69a-47706fa8dd67"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":199.25,"formatted":"199.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":13.125,"formatted":"13.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":16.98,"formatted":"16.98"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":53.21101,"formatted":"53.2"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":567.0,"formatted":"567"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":3.396,"formatted":"3.4"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":363,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":49,"formatted":"49","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":-0.6,"formatted":"-0.6"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.63,"formatted":"5.63"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":3.4,"formatted":"3.4"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":16.98,"formatted":"16.98"},"seasonAverage":{"value":3.396,"formatted":"3.4"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":4.5431337,"formatted":"4.54"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":5343,"nameFull":"Chad Henne","nameShort":"C.

While he had his moments, including a three-touchdown game against the Jets in Week 7, he failed to record a single 100-yard game all season, and he once again showed little ability to get past the first defender he encountered. Michel finished 29th in broken-tackle rate and 45th in average yards after contact (1.6), after ranking 33rd and 26th, respectively, as a rookie. With all but one of his rushing TDs coming from inside the 5-yard line, he was the very definition of a system running back, essentially producing only what his scheme and offensive line could create for him. The New England offense is now without Tom Brady for the first time in two decades, and there's no telling how much the running game will need to be emphasized in response, with either Cam Newton or Jarrett Stidham starting at quarterback. Even if he sees increased volume, Michel's lack of usage as a receiver and lack of explosiveness as a runner would seem to put a firm ceiling on his value, and there's also the threat of losing carries to 2019 third-round pick Damien Harris or even veteran Rex Burkhead.

He failed to make much of an impact on the ground, and his efficiency as a receiver took a significant step backward with his eight drops being a major eyesore, though some of that can be blamed on Mitchell Trubisky's inaccuracy. Cohen still has tremendous elusiveness and wheels in the open field, and he landed among the league leaders in top recorded speed when he hit 21.42 mph on a 71-yard punt return in Week 5. On the other hand, his lack of size (5-6, 191) and power becomes apparent when defenders do get their hands on him, as his average of 1.2 yards after contact last season would've ranked last if he had enough carries to qualify. The Bears brought in offensive coordinator Bill Lazor and veteran QB Nick Foles to help fix the passing game, additions that should benefit Cohen given his consistent passing-down role. That could allow him to return to something closer to the 8.0 yards per target he managed in 2018, rather than last season's ugly 4.4.

James White continued to be the team's primary receiver out of the backfield, while Sony Michel maintained a firm grasp on the early-down role despite subpar results. In fact, Burkhead didn't get double-digit touches in a game after sustaining a foot injury in Week 4, and most weeks he saw as much action on special teams as he did on offense.

The 29-year-old has averaged 57 targets, 43 catches and 376 yards the last four seasons, despite missing 17 games due to various lower-body injuries, and as recently as 2017 he was among the league leaders in yards per target (9.4, tops among running backs). The injuries have taken their toll on his elusiveness, however, and his declining effectiveness on the ground is a strong sign that his role will remain limited to passing downs. A move to Jacksonville to rejoin forces with Jay Gruden could keep Thompson relevant as he looks to carve into the 100 targets Leonard Fournette had last year, but the 29-year-old's best days may be behind him even if he's healthy."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0366fd06-19a3-4b69-8448-6bfbfad1250b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":129.5625,"formatted":"129.6"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":0.4375,"formatted":"0.4"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":11.525,"formatted":"11.5"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":71.6,"formatted":"71.6"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":138.0,"formatted":"138"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":42.0,"formatted":"42"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":378.0,"formatted":"378"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"formatted":"0"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":6.509091,"formatted":"6.51"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":194,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":55,"formatted":"55","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":211,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":69,"formatted":"RB69","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.6,"formatted":"1.6"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":4.13,"formatted":"4.13"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":4.52,"formatted":"4.52"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":71.6,"formatted":"71.6"},"seasonAverage":{"value":6.509091,"formatted":"6.51"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.3178465,"formatted":"3.32"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":7535,"nameFull":"Dion Lewis","nameShort":"D.

His outstanding balance allows him to stay on his feet through big collisions and gives him the potential for big gains after contact. That running style, and his college knee injury, do invite concerns about durability, but joining a backfield with Devin Singletary already in place should help keep Moss fresh and ready to hammer through another linebacker.

A downhill runner out of UCLA, he has the power and balance to hammer through contact, and, with a 4.49 40, good speed once he finds open space. His lack of vision, elusiveness or receiving skills make him unlikely to become a true three-down back, but as a complementary option behind new starter Austin Ekeler, Kelley could thrive between the tackles and in short-yardage situations. The rookie will compete with holdover Justin Jackson for those backup touches, and Kelley might be a better fit for the role, given that he's about 15 pounds heavier at 5-11, 212. With Ekeler relatively unproven in a full-time role, there could be a decent number of snaps and carries available for whoever emerges as the Chargers' No. 2 back."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"62542e04-3c44-4b75-8165-be674c8be75f"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":154.4375,"formatted":"154.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":12.7625,"formatted":"12.8"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":189,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":63,"formatted":"RB63","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15680,"nameFull":"DeeJay Dallas","nameShort":"D.

Ultimately taking Huntley in the fifth, the Lions managed to add someone with a completely different skill set than his new counterparts, and it's possible he may have a role in the offense right away. At 5-8, 190 with 4.4 speed, the New Mexico State product adds a uniquely explosive element to the run game, and there are whispers that the Lions could use him like they did J.D. McKissic last year. McKissic was only sharing the load with, at most, Johnson and Scarbrough, and Huntley arguably will have the best running back prospect in the draft added to the fold.

While he showed plenty of speed and elusiveness in college, Ahmed's lack of power, vision and indecisiveness when hitting the hole kept him from being a consistent producer. He did show solid receiving skills, but he'll need to significantly improve his effort level in pass protection if he wants to see significant work on passing downs in the NFL. Ahmed is something of a project, but in a Kyle Shanahan offense that always seems to find ways to get its backs the ball in space, his strengths could be accentuated and his flaws minimzed.

Williams expects to be healthy for the start of the year, but he might not return to 100 percent strength until midseason and likely will have to battle for targets behind Parker with emerging tight end Mike Gesicki and either Albert Wilson or Allen Hurns in the slot."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"497758de-5f0b-481f-8c68-7aa5e21df322"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":125.875,"formatted":"125.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":6.853125,"formatted":"6.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":73.8,"formatted":"73.8"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":32.0,"formatted":"32"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":428.0,"formatted":"428"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.225,"formatted":"9.23"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":187,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":76,"formatted":"76","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":130,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":50,"formatted":"WR50","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":21.7,"formatted":"21.7"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":12.37,"formatted":"12.37"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":9.36,"formatted":"9.36"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":73.8,"formatted":"73.8"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.225,"formatted":"9.23"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.0704403,"formatted":"5.07"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":7263,"nameFull":"Jake Kumerow","nameShort":"J.

It happened again last September when he piled up 277 yards and two touchdowns the first three weeks, before slumping through October and then suffering a major foot injury in November. Engram didn't play after Week 9, undergoing surgery in December to repair a Lisfranc ligament in his left foot. He should have time to recover before Week 1, but his offseason will revolve around rehab work after he spent the winter in a walking boot. Once he gets back on the field, Engram may find that a new coaching staff is more proactive putting his 4.42 speed to good use. Engram's 6.0 average depth of target last season placed 26th among qualified TEs, and that was actually a step up from his 5.0 aDOT the year before. Engram made it work, at least to an extent, with impressive YAC averages of 8.8 (2018) and 5.9 (2019), but it's hard to reach high-end TE1 territory when 80 percent of your targets come within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage. The good news is that Pat Shurmur, Mike Shula and Eli Manning are gone, replaced by Joe Judge, Jason Garrett and Daniel Jones.

Clearly, he's no longer the dangerous weapon that he was earlier in his career, but working in Graham's favor is that Matt Nagy's offense does prefer to use the tight end heavily, even though the team has had very little production from the position in the last two years.

The Alabama product stepped right in as the No. 2 TE behind Kyle Rudolph, averaging 38.3 snaps per game in an offense that used multiple tight ends on 55 percent of its plays (second highest rate in the league). Rudolph maintained his three-down role for most of the year and scored six touchdowns, but he also saw 77 snaps as a pass blocker, compared to only 21 for Smith. Rudolph finished with small advantages in routes (361 to 322), targets (48 to 47), catch rate (83.0 to 76.6), aDOT (6.5 to 5.8) and YAC average (4.9 to 4.1), with both tight ends serving as reliable but nonexplosive options for Kirk Cousins. The difference, of course, is that Smith is a young guy with 4.63 speed, while the 30-year-old Rudolph ran a 4.78 40 at his pro day nine years ago. By the end of last season, it was often Rudolph rather than Smith coming off the field on third downs. The trend figures to continue in 2020, and with rookie Justin Jefferson replacing Stefon Diggs at wide receiver, there's a nice opportunity for Smith to emerge as Option B or C in the Minnesota passing game."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"externalIds":[{"id":"ed0e6a30-83d5-4f4b-bf49-f7ff80e21304"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":53.5,"formatted":"53.5"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":6.325,"formatted":"6.3"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":60.1,"formatted":"60.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":36.0,"formatted":"36"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":311.0,"formatted":"311"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":4.292857,"formatted":"4.29"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388401,"name":"Wentz'z World","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388401_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":222,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":35,"formatted":"35","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":184,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":24,"formatted":"TE24"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.6,"formatted":"1.6"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":3.6,"formatted":"3.6"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":3.1,"formatted":"3.1"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":60.1,"formatted":"60.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":4.292857,"formatted":"4.29"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":2.884803,"formatted":"2.88"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13168,"nameFull":"Ricky Seals-Jones","nameShort":"R.

He matched his passing TDs...","description":"For the second year in a row, Watson finished fourth in QB fantasy scoring, posting similar numbers to 2018. He matched his passing TDs (26) in one fewer game and might have matched his passing yards had he played Week 17. His completion percentage, YPA and average depth of target were down slightly, while his bad-pass percentage remained unchanged. Watson's sacks fell from 62 to 44, though that was still sixth most. Fortunately, Watson is excellent on the run. He tied for the league lead in touchown passes outside the pocket with eight (Jameis Winston, Kirk Cousins) and was one of five quarterbacks to average more than five yards per rush (min. 50 attempts). He scored seven rushing touchdowns, tying Lamar Jackson for second among QBs behind Josh Allen's nine. While Watson's rushing skills give him a solid floor, his ceiling doesn't appear as high this season after All-Pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins was traded to Arizona. The Texans acquired oft-concussed Brandin Cooks - who is on his fourth team in six years and coming off a career-worst season - as another big-play threat alongside oft-injured Will Fuller and Kenny Stills. They also signed slot man Randall Cobb. That's a decent foursome (when healthy), but it doesn't make up for losing Hopkins. Arriving in the Hopkins trade is RB David Johnson, who peaked in 2016 and looked washed up last season. And while TE Darren Fells (seven TDs) is back, he's 34. Second-year coordinator Tim Kelly will calls plays this season, which hopefully lets Watson break free from coach Bill O'Brien's head-scratching game plans, but it would be fun to see what Watson could accomplish in a better setup."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"eec5265c-7731-4bb6-8af2-4f98a67f9ab7"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":240.375,"formatted":"240.4"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":1.3125,"formatted":"1.3"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":18.065624,"formatted":"18.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":313.48,"formatted":"313.48"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":67.27273,"formatted":"67.3"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3852.0,"formatted":"3,852"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":26.0,"formatted":"26"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":12.0,"formatted":"12"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":20.898668,"formatted":"20.9"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":5,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":4,"formatted":"4","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":63,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":6,"formatted":"QB6","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.06,"formatted":"8.06"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":17.35,"formatted":"17.35"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":19.67,"formatted":"19.67"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":313.48,"formatted":"313.48"},"seasonAverage":{"value":20.898668,"formatted":"20.9"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.679482,"formatted":"9.68"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":8514,"nameFull":"Ryan Tannehill","nameShort":"R.

Tannehill entered the season as the backup to Marcus Mariota but was named the starter by Week 7, and proceeded to throw 22 TDs in 10 starts, finishing as the league's top-rated passer (117.5). Tannehill, who took over a 2-4 team and went 7-3 as the starter en route to the AFC championship game, led the league in YPA (9.6), ranked second in TD pass percentage (7.7) and ranked third in completion percentage (70.3). He dominated on intermediate routes - 25.2 percent of his attempts were in the 11-20-yard range (2nd), where he led the league with both a 70.8 completion percentage and 14.1 YPA. And he was particularly effective on play action, ranking first in YPA (14.8) and third in completion percentage (78.4). Tannehill also dominated in the red zone with 14 TD passes, though his 37.8 TD pass percentage is a good bet to regress closer to league average (23.2). Tannehill not only garnered NFL Comeback Player of the Year honors but also a four-year, $118 million contract. He returns this year with some solid weapons, including WR A.J. Brown, who's coming off a 1,000-yard rookie season, and 247-pound RB Derrick Henry, who softens defenses for the play action. The downside of a 300-carry RB, though, is fewer passing attempts, and Tannehill's not likely to see much more than 500. That, coupled with a likely regression in efficiency (his previous high YPA was 7.7), makes it hard for Tannehill to be a viable starter in single-QB leagues."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"5812204c-6dae-4450-8011-99e0f72864ac"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":238.875,"formatted":"238.9"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":1.1875,"formatted":"1.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":18.203125,"formatted":"18.2"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":221.18001,"formatted":"221.18"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":70.27972,"formatted":"70.3"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":2742.0,"formatted":"2,742"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":22.0,"formatted":"22"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":18.431667,"formatted":"18.43"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":34,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":22,"formatted":"22","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":119,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":16,"formatted":"QB16"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":17.92,"formatted":"17.92"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":21.92,"formatted":"21.92"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":21.42,"formatted":"21.42"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":221.18001,"formatted":"221.18"},"seasonAverage":{"value":18.431667,"formatted":"18.43"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.7912445,"formatted":"8.79"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14745,"nameFull":"Miles Sanders","nameShort":"M.

At 5-8, 190, his 4.39 speed remains his biggest asset, and Lindsay's burst and low center of gravity can make him tough to bring down even if he doesn't have a lot of wiggle to his running style. His limitations have become more apparent in his two NFL seasons, however. His lack of size makes him a liability as a pass blocker, and he doesn't have reliable hands as a receiver, piling up 12 drops on only 95 career targets - perhaps in part due to ongoing wrist issues that he hopes will be corrected with a second surgery this offseason. Denver brought in Melvin Gordon to supplant Lindsay atop the depth chart, but it's more likely to be a 1A/1B situation rather than starter and backup. New offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur has had some success with backfield tandems and committees, notably in 2017 when the Vikings juggled Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon after Dalvin Cook suffered an ACL tear. With a healthier offensive line in front of him as well, Lindsay could return to his rookie levels of efficiency, even if he doesn't see a comparable workload."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"externalIds":[{"id":"8322b598-ab65-4b2c-8a54-af37f67a062d"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":133.3125,"formatted":"133.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":14.78125,"formatted":"14.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":180.2,"formatted":"180.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1011.0,"formatted":"1,011"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":35.0,"formatted":"35"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":196.0,"formatted":"196"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.2625,"formatted":"11.26"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":67,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":19,"formatted":"19","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":107,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":40,"formatted":"RB40","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":5.3,"formatted":"5.3"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.1,"formatted":"9.1"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":9.5,"formatted":"9.5"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":180.2,"formatted":"180.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.2625,"formatted":"11.26"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.5897536,"formatted":"6.59"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12025,"nameFull":"Ezekiel Elliott","nameShort":"E.

Once he had a new six-year extension in his pocket, Zeke resumed his role as the focal point of the Dallas offense and barely missed a beat, finding the end zone in six of the first seven games en route to 1,777 scrimmage yards and 14 TDs. Elliott simply does everything well, but it's his ability to handle a huge workload that might be his most impressive attribute. He led the league in red-zone rushes (61) and tied Aaron Jones in TDs from inside the 5 with 10, and only Derrick Henry saw more than Elliott's 301 total carries - the third time in four seasons Elliott has topped 300. The Cowboys head into 2020 facing some significant changes, however. Gone is long-time coach Jason Garrett, and while OC Kellen Moore remains, new head coach Mike McCarthy is likely to favor a more pass-friendly scheme. Perhaps more important, five-time Pro Bowler Travis Frederick retired, leaving Joe Looney as the starting center. Elliott posted strong numbers in 2018 when Frederick missed the entire season, but the combination of uncertainty in front of him and a potential loss of some touches to backup Tony Pollard could prevent Zeke from producing at an elite level again."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"externalIds":[{"id":"bef8b2b4-78bd-4a4d-bb5d-6b55ada9ef6a"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":131.0625,"formatted":"131.1"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":13.9875,"formatted":"14"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":283.69998,"formatted":"283.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1357.0,"formatted":"1,357"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":54.0,"formatted":"54"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":420.0,"formatted":"420"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":14.0,"formatted":"14"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":17.731249,"formatted":"17.73"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":10,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":3,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"RB3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":25.9,"formatted":"25.9"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":22.43,"formatted":"22.43"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":21.16,"formatted":"21.16"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":283.69998,"formatted":"283.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":17.731249,"formatted":"17.73"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.717488,"formatted":"5.72"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":9311,"nameFull":"DeAndre Hopkins","nameShort":"D.

Hopkins played through a rib injury for a good chunk of the year and sat out the regular-season finale, but he still managed a 104-1,165-7 campaign in his age-27 season. The biggest difference between 2018 and 2019 was the efficiency - Hopkins dropped from 13.7 YPC and 9.6 YPT to 11.2 and 7.8, respectively. Maybe it was the injury, or maybe Hopkins is slowing down in his late prime, but he simply stopped making big plays - only one of his 150 targets went for 40-plus yards, and 16 went for 20 or more yards. At 6-1, 212, Hopkins has good size and vies with Michael Thomas for the best hands in the game. His body control and toe tapping on the sidelines are second to none. Hopkins has never been especially fast - 4.57 40 at the combine - but his superior route running and ball skills have more than made up for it. Surprisingly, Hopkins didn't see much red-zone work last year (13 targets, T-26th), which largely explains why he scored only seven times. (In 2018, he saw 25 red-zone looks and scored 11 TDs.) Hopkins isn't huge, but he has ideal red-zone skills, so expect some positive regression both in opportunity and output. Surprisingly, the Texans traded their star wideout to the Cardinals for the aforementioned Johnson in March, setting up Hopkins in what's likely to be one of the faster-paced and more prolific passing offenses in the league. With training camps possibly delayed, there's some risk in taking a receiver with a new city, team and quarterback, but Kyler Murray is a rising star, and Hopkins should be his top target ahead of holdovers Larry Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"externalIds":[{"id":"5c48ade7-4b9a-4757-9643-87a6e3839e2b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":131.875,"formatted":"131.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":216.54,"formatted":"216.54"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":104.0,"formatted":"104"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1165.0,"formatted":"1,165"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.436,"formatted":"14.44"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":37,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":5,"formatted":"5","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":15,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":6,"formatted":"WR6","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":4.8,"formatted":"4.8"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":14.13,"formatted":"14.13"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":15.99,"formatted":"15.99"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":216.54,"formatted":"216.54"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.436,"formatted":"14.44"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.699095,"formatted":"6.7"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":10307,"nameFull":"Jarvis Landry","nameShort":"J.

But he did so last season on a bad hip down the stretch, an injury that eventually required surgery in February. Even so, amidst a dysfunctional system, Landry had the most efficient season of his career - 14.1 YPC and 8.5 YPT and 20 catches of 20-plus yards (T-6th) - despite largely lining up in the slot. At 5-11, 196, Landry is stout and quick, and he has excellent hands (four drops all year), but he ran a glacial-for-his-size 4.77 40 at the 2014 combine. Somehow, he knows how to get open, and no matter what team he plays for or who his quarterback is, Landry always gets his targets. The Browns should be improved all around this year. Freddie Kitchens is gone, and new coach Kevin Stefanski should be a significant improvement with a better zone blocking/play-action passing scheme that gives Baker Mayfield more time to throw. But with a presumably healthy Odell Beckham on the outside and newly acquired tight end Austin Hooper often lining up in the slot, Landry's target share theoretically should decline, were it not for his mysterious power to compel passes his way. In any event, Landry's recovery from hip surgery is likely to keep him out until August, but his status for the start of the year does not appear to be in too much jeopardy."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"06e41dc1-d5dc-4bdc-8fc3-e0d7c3a99ac4"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":159.625,"formatted":"159.6"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":8.75,"formatted":"8.7"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":195.90001,"formatted":"195.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":83.0,"formatted":"83"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1174.0,"formatted":"1,174"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.243751,"formatted":"12.24"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":54,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":13,"formatted":"13","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":67,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":30,"formatted":"WR30"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":15.2,"formatted":"15.2"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":10.3,"formatted":"10.3"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.22,"formatted":"10.22"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":195.90001,"formatted":"195.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.243751,"formatted":"12.24"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.844064,"formatted":"6.84"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":9338,"nameFull":"Robert Woods","nameShort":"R.

Woods went from 14.2 YPC and 9.4 YPT to 12.6 and 8.2, respectively. Despite drawing nine more targets, Woods had six fewer catches of 20-plus yards. With fewer big plays and a less potent offense, Woods found paydirt only three times all year, and one of those was on a handoff. That's not likely to change too much, as Woods is rarely used in the red zone (nine targets) or near the goal line (three targets). At 6-0, 195, Woods has only average size, and his 4.51 speed is similarly pedestrian. His best assets are his route running, hands (he dropped only two of 139 targets) and understanding of Sean McVay's offense. Woods also played 94 percent of the Rams' offensive snaps, far more than teammate Cooper Kupp (80 percent). With Brandin Cooks now in Houston, Woods will reprise his role as a featured member in the team's offense, and the jet-sweep handoffs should give him another hundred-ish yards and a chance for a score. But there's more floor than ceiling in this skill set, and Kupp and tight end Tyler Higbee are the red-zone locks and better bets for touchdowns."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"externalIds":[{"id":"618bedee-9259-4536-b0ff-fec98d2a20de"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":137.125,"formatted":"137.1"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":7,"mean":{"value":7.89375,"formatted":"7.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":187.9,"formatted":"187.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":90.0,"formatted":"90"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1134.0,"formatted":"1,134"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.526667,"formatted":"12.53"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":60,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":17,"formatted":"17","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":40,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":18,"formatted":"WR18","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":17.1,"formatted":"17.1"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":12.37,"formatted":"12.37"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.6,"formatted":"16.6"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":187.9,"formatted":"187.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.526667,"formatted":"12.53"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.468639,"formatted":"6.47"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":9376,"nameFull":"Zach Ertz","nameShort":"Z.

His 6.8 YPT was a career low, but it wasn't a matter of an unusual number of drops (seven, 5.2 percent), and his YAC average (3.2) was unchanged from 2018. The Eagles' lack of downfield weapons finally seemed to catch up to Ertz, with his catch rate hitting its lowest point since 2014 as opponents had little else to worry about with the Philadelphia passing game. It didn't help that fellow TE Dallas Goedert took some scoring chances away from Ertz, who finished with a three-year low for red-zone targets (16) and a four-year low for targets inside the 10 (five). However, Ertz was still a three-down player throughout the season, ranking fourth among TEs in snap share (85.9) - his fourth consecutive year reaching 80 percent. The Eagles' offseason overhaul of their wideout group creates more competition for targets, and possibly even snaps, but it could also create an offense where the 29-year-old Ertz has more room to operate and thus moves back toward his pre-2019 career marks for catch rate (69.4 percent) and YPT (7.7). In addition to the possibility of a healthier season from DeSean Jackson, the Eagles can strike fear in the hearts of opposing safeties with rookie wideouts Jalen Reagor (4.47 40), John Hightower (4.45) and Quez Watkins (4.35). If the speed element proves dangerous, it'll be feeding time underneath for Ertz, Goedert and Miles Sanders."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"externalIds":[{"id":"de3421f7-2147-4835-89a5-724e87bad463"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6157,"away":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"home":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":54.875,"formatted":"54.9"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":0.5625,"formatted":"0.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":6.78125,"formatted":"6.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":171.6,"formatted":"171.6"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":88.0,"formatted":"88"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":916.0,"formatted":"916"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.440001,"formatted":"11.44"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":75,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":5,"formatted":"5","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":47,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":4,"formatted":"TE4","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":4.8,"formatted":"4.8"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":15.0,"formatted":"15"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":14.0,"formatted":"14"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":171.6,"formatted":"171.6"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.440001,"formatted":"11.44"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.7566056,"formatted":"6.76"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":6038,"nameFull":"Matthew Stafford","nameShort":"M.

After Stafford had a career-low number of attempts for a full season in Matt Patricia's first year as head coach in 2018, the Lions hired run-heavy offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell last year. But instead of seeing even fewer attempts, as expected, Stafford came out throwing. By midseason, he was on pace to challenge career highs with nearly 5,000 yards and 38 touchdowns. But then, after not missing a start for eight consecutive years, his season ended thanks to multiple fractures in his back and a hip injury in Week 9. Stafford's production wasn't just about volume; the Lions continually attacked downfield. Despite playing only eight games, Stafford attempted 50 passes of more than 20 yards (19th), throwing six touchdown passes - more than 21 qualified quarterbacks. His percentage of attempts longer than 10 yards (36.4) ranked fourth, as he posted a league-high 11.3-yard average depth of target and the second-highest YPA (8.6). Will the Lions continue the aerial assault this season? They drafted RB D'Andre Swift to pair in the backfield with Kerryon Johnson, perhaps signaling a desire for more balance after ranking 20th in the league last year in run-play percentage (39.9). It also doesn't seem likely at age 32 coming off a serious back injury that Stafford can keep pace over a full season with last year's career-high passing rates, especially his 6.5 TD pass percentage (4th), even with an excellent group of receivers in Kenny Golladay, Marvin Jones, Danny Amendola and 6-5 tight end T.J.

The 2019 second-round pick had his moments but was mostly no better than average, with one great game, one bad game and three mediocre games. Lock struggled with accuracy at Missouri (56.9 completion percentage), but last season completed 64.1 percent of his 156 attempts. However, he rarely showed off his strong arm, attempting just 13 passes longer than 20 yards, completing three. Part of that was due to a lack of playmakers, as Courtland Sutton was Lock's only weapon. The Broncos used this year's draft to stock their skill positions. They drafted Jerry Jeudy (4.45 40) with the 15th overall pick, added speedster KJ Hamler in the second round, and in the fourth round took 6-5 TE Albert Okwuegbunam, a college teammate of Lock's.

Even after being activated, he didn't have a meaningful role until Week 14, when he turned 16 touches into 128 yards and a touchdown. Scott, while undersized, offers some intriguing tools as a running back. He's densely built at 5-6, 203, and he ran 4.40 40-yard dash at his pro day in 2018. He's also useful in the passing game, as evidenced by 24 receptions and one drop on 26 targets last season. If that list of assets sounds familiar, it might be because Darren Sproles turned them into a long, productive career. The final six seasons of that career were spent in Philadelphia, where Doug Pederson has found use for a wide variety of running backs while favoring a committee approach. Scott has a long way to go to become the next Sproles, of course, but with the Eagles doing little in the offseason to bolster their depth chart, the 25-year-old could enter training camp as the No. 2 option behind Miles Sanders."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"externalIds":[{"id":"768f6afa-ba24-40d9-bdc1-3184bba2ec2b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6157,"away":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"home":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":173.8125,"formatted":"173.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":17.88125,"formatted":"17.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":81.899994,"formatted":"81.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":245.0,"formatted":"245"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":24.0,"formatted":"24"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":204.0,"formatted":"204"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.099999,"formatted":"9.1"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":173,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":49,"formatted":"49","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":149,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":50,"formatted":"RB50","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":33.8,"formatted":"33.8"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":15.9,"formatted":"15.9"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.9,"formatted":"13.9"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":81.899994,"formatted":"81.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.099999,"formatted":"9.1"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":10.647692,"formatted":"10.65"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":8512,"nameFull":"Lamar Miller","nameShort":"L.

The team is giving him one last chance on a restructured deal, and if McKinnon is finally healthy again, there's still reason for some extremely cautious optimism. Before tearing his ACL two years ago, he showed the speed and receiving skills to be an effective weapon on passing downs, and while he lacks vision and patience as a runner between the tackles, he can still do plenty of damage in open space - something Kyle Shanahan's offensive scheme is notorious for creating for its running backs. Last season's breakout star, Raheem Mostert, heads the backfield entering 2020, and Tevin Coleman (a back with similar strengths and weaknesses to McKinnon) also remains on hand, but if the former Viking can stay in one piece, there should be touches available for him in one of the league's most explosive rushing attacks."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"f77479d7-51a5-41f9-8924-69526dd078cd"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":148.3125,"formatted":"148.3"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.8125,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":14.0875,"formatted":"14.1"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":231,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":76,"formatted":"RB76","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true},{"proPlayer":{"id":15568,"nameFull":"A.J.

He doesn't have much elusiveness, but he didn't need it during his college career given how difficult he was to bring down, and he has the frame to withstand the punishment his bludgeoning running style brings with it. Dillon could provide the thunder in a very effective backfield tandem, and Jones' league-leading 10 touchdowns from inside the 5-yard line last season could be up for grabs if Dillon takes the short-yardage role.

His efficiency numbers were merely average - 12.7 YPC, 8.2 YPT - but he had four catches of 40-plus yards on only 71 targets, showcasing his elite deep speed. We don't have a 40 time for Brown, who had a broken foot during the 2019 NFL Combine, but take it from college teammate Baker Mayfield who said Brown had a gear fellow Oklahoma wideout Dede Westbrook (4.39 40) lacked. At 5-9, 170, Brown is small and slight, in the DeSean Jackson mold, but the Ravens somehow targeted him a lot from in close - 13 red-zone targets and six inside the 10 on modest overall volume. Brown had offseason surgery to remove a screw from his foot, but it was far less serious than what he dealt with coming into 2019, i.e., unlike last year he should be full go heading into camp. Tight end Mark Andrews is likely to remain Lamar Jackson's favorite target, but Jackson's arm strength is not in doubt, and Brown should be one of the league's most dangerous deep threats even if his target ceiling is modest."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"externalIds":[{"id":"feeee40a-dd63-41a7-89cd-6c95b5456833"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":142.3125,"formatted":"142.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":7.85625,"formatted":"7.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":123.40001,"formatted":"123.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":46.0,"formatted":"46"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":584.0,"formatted":"584"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":8.814286,"formatted":"8.81"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":119,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":45,"formatted":"45"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":69,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":31,"formatted":"WR31"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":2.5,"formatted":"2.5"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.37,"formatted":"5.37"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":3.6,"formatted":"3.6"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":123.40001,"formatted":"123.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":8.814286,"formatted":"8.81"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.852829,"formatted":"7.85"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13052,"nameFull":"Dede Westbrook","nameShort":"D.

At 6-0, 178, Westbrook is slight but fast - his 4.37 40 is unusually fast for a slot receiver. And he has enough vision in the open field to return punts, one of which he took to the house in 2018. But without red-zone volume or targets down the field, it's hard to see Westbrook doing more than catching short passes and hoping to make someone miss, as he's not much of a tackle breaker.

Not that his 18 touchdowns over 26 games are anything to sneeze at, but his numbers pale in comparison to those of fellow top prospects Jerry Jeudy (his Alabama teammate) and CeeDee Lamb. Where Ruggs has them beat, however, is in pure speed and explosiveness. He ran a blistering 4.27 40 at the combine, and his 42-inch vertical and 131-inch broad jump were similarly off the charts. At 5-11, 188, Ruggs is small, though slightly larger than other NFL speedsters like Tyreek Hill and DeSean Jackson. The question is what kind of role he'll have at the NFL level. There's no doubt he'll slot in as the Raiders' key field stretcher and big-play threat - after all, he was the first receiver chosen at pick 12. But there's a big difference between getting Jackson's 90-100 targets per year and Hill's 135-140, and Ruggs has competition from tight end Darren Waller, slot man Hunter Renfrow, wideout Tyrell Williams and fellow rookie Bryan Edwards."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"externalIds":[{"id":"8a453858-7309-49ae-b8eb-de691847393f"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":175.75,"formatted":"175.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":9.996875,"formatted":"10"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":140,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":55,"formatted":"WR55","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15703,"nameFull":"Quintez Cephus","nameShort":"Q.

With that said, Cephus could still be in for a long season of learning as Kenny Golladay, Marvin Jones and Danny Amendola gobble up the vast majority of snaps at receiver on his new team. The Lions also signed Geronimo Allison and have Marvin Hall around, so Cephus might not even be the next man up. Cephus certainly could work his way there, but he probably won't see consistent playing time until 2021, at the earliest, when he'll be the only Lions receiver under contract.

Once known for playing 16 games in nine consecutive seasons, the veteran tight end missed 18 games his final three years in Carolina, mostly bothered by his foot. Olsen made it through 2019 without a serious flare up in his irksome foot, instead missing a pair of December contests due to a concussion. He otherwise remained reasonably effective given the circumstances of Kyle Allen playing quarterback, producing 7.3 YPT while posting the 10th-deepest aDOT (8.7) among tight ends. Olsen won't break many tackles, but his work on intermediate routes remains steady after all these years. Last season, he saw 35 targets in the range of 10 to 19 yards downfield, hauling in 19 for 327 yards. If nothing else, the 35-year-old should have more scoring opportunities in Seattle, where Jacob Hollister and Will Dissly combined for a 64-611-7 receiving line on 86 targets last year. Hollister and Dissly remain on the roster - along with fourth-round pick Colby Parkinson - but only Dissly profiles as a serious threat to Olsen, and the 24-year-old is rehabbing a torn Achilles."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"externalIds":[{"id":"587d0a98-7ec5-45a5-adba-8af26e8f256b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6156,"away":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"home":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":52.625,"formatted":"52.6"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":6.875,"formatted":"6.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":97.7,"formatted":"97.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":52.0,"formatted":"52"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":597.0,"formatted":"597"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":6.9785714,"formatted":"6.98"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388570,"name":"Denton Dynamos"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":148,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":13,"formatted":"13","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":172,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":23,"formatted":"TE23"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":2.2,"formatted":"2.2"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":3.4,"formatted":"3.4"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.06,"formatted":"5.06"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":97.7,"formatted":"97.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":6.9785714,"formatted":"6.98"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.878188,"formatted":"5.88"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":15575,"nameFull":"Adam Trautman","nameShort":"A.

He led the nation in passing yards (5,671) and completion percentage (76.3) while throwing an FBS-record 60 TD passes, guiding LSU to the national championship and winning the Heisman Trophy along with pretty much every passing award. Making him the No. 1 pick in the draft was an easy choice for the Bengals. Also an easy choice was releasing long-time starting QB Andy Dalton one week later (and saving $17 million) to make Burrow the unquestioned starter. At 6-3, 221, Burrow has good size, and scouts rave about his leadership, competitiveness and football IQ. He doesn't possess elite arm strength - it's below average for an NFL starter - but he has tremendous vision, rapidly works through his progressions, has excellent touch and is consistently accurate. He has a skilled group of playmakers to help him acclimate in Cincinnati, with A.J. Green, Tyler Boyd and Joe Mixon returning and 6-3 wideout Tee Higgins drafted in the second round. The biggest concern is the offensive line. The Bengals were terrible up front last season, but the return of 2019 first-round pick LT Jonah Williams from an injury should help, as should the signing of RG Xavier Su'a-Filo. Fortunately, Burrow is plenty mobile, capable of extending plays with his legs and making throws on the move. If he plays 16 games as expected, the rookie should have enough passing volume (the Bengals threw 616 times last season, 6th most) that it won't take much for him to be a top-10 fantasy QB with his rushing contributions."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"externalIds":[{"id":"3023ac10-4e7f-425f-9fc5-2b8e6332c92e"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":3,"mean":{"value":210.875,"formatted":"210.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":1.3125,"formatted":"1.3"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":16.25625,"formatted":"16.3"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":137,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":19,"formatted":"QB19"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":14668,"nameFull":"Daniel Jones","nameShort":"D.

His first start came Week 3, and by Week 16, when he became the first rookie in NFL history to pass for 350-plus yards, five TDs and no interceptions in a game, it was clear he had pushed Eli Manning into retirement. In addition to a slew of Giants rookie passing records, he had three games (in 12 starts) in which he passed for at least 300 yards, four TDs and no interceptions - something only two rookies in league history had done even once. At 6-5, Jones has wheels - he clocked two of the fastest runs last season among quarterbacks (19.51, 19.47 mph) - adding to his fantasy upside. The downside was turnovers. He had a bottom-10 INT rate (2.6 percent) and was plagued by fumbles. His 18 fumbles were fifth most all-time, and his 11 fumbles lost tied Tony Banks (1996) for the most by a rookie since 1970. Jones, who has average hand size (9 3/4 inches), held onto the ball too long at times, but he also got little help from an offensive line that allowed pressure on a league-high 29.6 percent of his dropbacks. The Giants hope fourth overall draft pick Andrew Thomas, the projected starter at right tackle, will stabilize the line. Led by elite RB Saquon Barkley, Jones has a solid supporting cast, including WR Darius Slayton, with whom he developed an excellent downfield connection even though his deep-ball passing was lacking overall (25.5 completion percentage on attempts longer than 20 yards). Perhaps new offensive coordinator Jason Garrett can hone the aggressiveness of Jones, who was noted for downfield accuracy out of college.

The Raiders wasted little time in letting him prove he could be their top guy, and the rookie delivered, averaging 20.2 touches in 13 games (a lingering shoulder injury cost him three weeks in December). Often playing at less than 100 percent healthy, Jacobs displayed an impressive ability to plow through traffic with power and balance, finishing ninth in broken tackle rate (one for every 9.3 carries). Despite his generally successful first campaign, Jacobs still has some things to prove. That he wore down as the season progressed isn't exactly encouraging, and he wasn't a difference-maker as a receiving weapon, though the team's passing attack in general was a disappointment beyond TE Darren Waller. The Raiders are counting on rookies to spark improvement, with first-round pick Henry Ruggs and third-round pick Bryan Edwards joining Tyrell Williams to give the offense more of a downfield component. Ruggs, in particular, can prevent safeties from creeping toward the line to stop the run, with a 4.27 40 making him one of the fastest players in the league. But it wasn't all good news for Jacobs this offseason, as the Raiders also made commitments to pass-catching weapons for their backfield, re-signing Jalen Richard to a two-year, $7 million contract and later drafting Lynn Bowden in the third round. Jacobs' lead role on the ground is safe, but room for receiving growth appears somewhat limited."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"externalIds":[{"id":"61694ab9-b099-408e-b48d-6a643dd069ec"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":150.0,"formatted":"150"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":2.0625,"formatted":"2.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":17.925,"formatted":"17.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":181.59999,"formatted":"181.6"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1150.0,"formatted":"1,150"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":20.0,"formatted":"20"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":166.0,"formatted":"166"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.96923,"formatted":"13.97"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":65,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":18,"formatted":"18","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":13,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":9,"formatted":"RB9","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.9,"formatted":"11.9"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":8.8,"formatted":"8.8"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":11.18,"formatted":"11.18"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":181.59999,"formatted":"181.6"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.96923,"formatted":"13.97"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.113629,"formatted":"7.11"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13772,"nameFull":"Rashaad Penny","nameShort":"R.

Four of Golladay's five 100-yard games came with Stafford, as did seven of his league-leading 11 receiving touchdowns. Paired with Jeff Driskel and David Blough for eight games, Golladay still managed 10.3 YPT (2nd), 18.3 YPC (1st), 22 catches of 20-plus yards (2nd) and six catches of 40-plus (T-6th) for the season. He also led the league in touchdowns despite being only 25th in targets (115). While Golladay was tied for just 13th in red-zone targets, he led the league in inside-the-10 targets with 13, i.e., he was the Lions' clear go-to guy in the end zone. At 6-4, 213, Golladay is big, long and agile. He ran a 4.5 40 at the 2017 combine, which is only average for a wide receiver, but for his height and weight it's fast. Golladay turns 27 in November, so he's old for a player heading into his fourth season, but he seems to be improving through his prime. Moreover, Stafford will be back for the start of the year, and Golladay's role as the team's top target, downfield option and red-zone threat is secure. Marvin Jones will be 30, while Danny Amendola (a small slot guy) and second-year tight end T.J.

He's dangerous in open space and down the field, and Russell Wilson often looks to him when plays break down and Wilson is scrambling around in the pocket. The downside for Lockett is three-fold: first, given his slight frame, it would be surprising if he maintained his red-zone volume; second, the Seahawks are perennially in the bottom third of the league in pass attempts; and third, second-year man DK Metcalf emerged down the stretch and looks like a future star and downfield playmaker.

He dominates when the ball is in the air, using his height, catch radius and good hands to outreach smaller defenders.

He has missed at least two games every year, including 14 the last two seasons. Fuller's per-play numbers are always excellent, and he had four catches of 40-plus yards on only 71 targets in 2019, i.e., his big-play ability is still very much intact. At 6-0, 184, Fuller is slight but very fast - he ran a 4.32 40 at the 2016 combine - and at age 26 is still in his prime. He'll also have a chance to be the team's top receiver with target hog DeAndre Hopkins now in Arizona. But while Fuller's completely recovered from January sports hernia surgery, and his 2018 ACL tear should be 100 percent healed, he'll have to fend off fellow holdover and deep threat Kenny Stills and newly acquired (and also injury prone) deep-threat Brandin Cooks. The Texans also signed Randall Cobb for slot work, so there are a few mouths to feed even without Hopkins around, but Fuller has the most upside of the four, and with Deshaun Watson under center, he could be a difference maker."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"095e0c1a-0bea-4bc6-868f-e4bbe2ce6c30"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":123.5,"formatted":"123.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":3,"mean":{"value":7.384375,"formatted":"7.4"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":108.5,"formatted":"108.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":49.0,"formatted":"49"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":670.0,"formatted":"670"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.863636,"formatted":"9.86"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":133,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":54,"formatted":"54","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":79,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":35,"formatted":"WR35"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":2.1,"formatted":"2.1"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":6.12,"formatted":"6.12"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":108.5,"formatted":"108.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.863636,"formatted":"9.86"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":12.150665,"formatted":"12.15"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13845,"nameFull":"Mike Gesicki","nameShort":"M.

Even then, his flurry was based on volume rather than efficiency, with a 51.3 percent catch rate and 6.4 YPT landing south of his marks for the full season. To be fair, the Miami offense wasn't exactly a beacon of efficiency, and Gesicki's catch rate looks a bit better given that his 9.8-yard average depth of target for the season was second to only Mark Andrews' 10.4 among 13 tight ends with 70-plus targets. Gesicki was actually the only one of that group to finish the year without a drop, but a 3.7 YAC average (10th) is weak stuff from a guy who placed first among TEs at the 2018 combine in the 40-yard dash (4.54 sec.), vertical jump (41.5 in.), broad jump (129 in.) and three-cone drill (6.76 sec.). Fortunately, Gesicki has every opportunity to channel his freakish athleticism into better results, as the Dolphins otherwise appear barren at tight end and also don't look so hot at running back or wide receiver. This is an interesting collision of talent and opportunity, albeit with the added roadblocks of a questionable offensive line and either Ryan Fitzpatrick or Tua Tagovailoa at QB."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"1012cbe0-7eba-4169-bfca-183a0204e1a7"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":43.0,"formatted":"43"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":0.4375,"formatted":"0.4"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":5.43125,"formatted":"5.4"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":110.49999,"formatted":"110.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":51.0,"formatted":"51"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":570.0,"formatted":"570"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":7.3666663,"formatted":"7.37"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":131,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":11,"formatted":"11","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":124,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"TE15"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.4,"formatted":"11.4"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":13.77,"formatted":"13.77"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.76,"formatted":"11.76"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":110.49999,"formatted":"110.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":7.3666663,"formatted":"7.37"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.116717,"formatted":"6.12"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14860,"nameFull":"Gardner Minshew","nameShort":"G.

He ranked sixth in the NFL with a 1.3 INT percentage, throwing only six picks on 470 attempts, and led the rookie class with a 91.2 passer rating. Minshew does not have a strong arm (why he fell to the sixth round), but his timing and touch are excellent, making him one of the league's better deep-ball passers. He led the NFL in completion percentage (47.6), YPA (17.2) and passer rating (125.6) on attempts longer than 20 yards last season (min. 30 attempts). He also effectively used play action to beat defenses, ranking second in completion percentage (79.3) and third in passer rating (142.7). While he's not tall at 6-1, he's a good athlete who can make plays with his legs (344 rushing yards, 5th among QBs), though he needs to improve his ball security after fumbling 13 times, losing seven. Minshew completed just 60.6 percent of his passes last year, but accuracy was a strength coming out of college (70.7 percent, 2nd nationally) and with his quick release and skilled progression work, it's reasonable to expect improvement in Year 2. New OC Jay Gruden should help, and Foles is gone, so Minshew won't be looking over his shoulder this season."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"externalIds":[{"id":"dabb52c0-455b-48fe-996b-abf758120623"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":263.6875,"formatted":"263.7"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":1.8125,"formatted":"1.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":21.565624,"formatted":"21.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":223.34,"formatted":"223.34"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":60.638298,"formatted":"60.6"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3271.0,"formatted":"3,271"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":21.0,"formatted":"21"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":15.952857,"formatted":"15.95"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":32,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":21,"formatted":"21","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":153,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":23,"formatted":"QB23","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":23.5,"formatted":"23.5"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":19.03,"formatted":"19.03"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":16.07,"formatted":"16.07"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":223.34,"formatted":"223.34"},"seasonAverage":{"value":15.952857,"formatted":"15.95"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.49439,"formatted":"5.49"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":8628,"nameFull":"Robert Griffin","nameShort":"R.

But he has some issues to overcome before the Chargers crown him heir apparent to Philip Rivers. Herbert has a rifle for an arm to attack downfield but, according to scouts, lacks touch on his deep ball, and his footwork and mechanics are apt to break down under pressure. Despite being a four-year starter at Oregon, Herbert was noted for his inconsistency - even as senior. In his final four games, he stumbled to 58.9 percent passing with four TDs, three INTs and 202 yards per game. And while his timed speed was third fastest among quarterbacks at the combine, Herbert seemed to reluctant to tuck it and run as a collegian. He also needs to adapt to an NFL route tree after playing in Oregon's limited offensive scheme, though that shouldn't be too high a hurdle for the winner of last year's \"Academic Heisman.\" Plus, with Tyrod Taylor entering camp as the starter, Herbert has time to develop his game before likely taking the reins later in the year. When he does, he'll have an improved offensive line protecting him with Mike Pouncey returning from injury, joined by the newly acquired Trai Turner and Bryan Bulaga. He also has excellent weapons to target, including Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler.

With Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay, few pegged Love to end up a Packer, but that's where he landed. The Packers even traded up to select him, so it's clear management likes his potential. Most quarterbacks taken in the first round these days start at some point in their first year, but that's a long shot in Love's case barring a Rodgers injury. Rodgers is under contract for four more seasons, but if the rookie develops like the Packers hope, they could go younger and cheaper at the position at some point in the coming years."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e5094779-e94f-4052-8597-bdbee3719f6b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":253.8125,"formatted":"253.8"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":1.4375,"formatted":"1.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":18.071875,"formatted":"18.1"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15418,"nameFull":"Patrick Laird","nameShort":"P.

But the rookie barely saw the field as Lamar Jackson provided that electricity instead. Hill's top-shelf speed (4.40 40-yard dash) and elusiveness could make him intriguing if he gets on the field, but the Ravens did not trust him on passing downs and rarely used him as a runner before the late stages of blowouts. The addition of J.K. Dobbins in the second round of this year's draft pushes Hill even farther from relevance, but if he can show enough to hang onto a roster spot, things might brighten considerably for Hill in 2021. Ingram and Edwards could both be in different uniforms at that point, potentially leaving Hill as Dobbins' top backup.

Over a four-game stretch as the lead back, the Alabama product rushed 89 times at 4.2 yards per carry, and that was with mostly incompetent quarterback play from a combination of backups. Matthew Stafford's return is a massive upgrade from last year's cast of reserve signal-callers, and all Lions skill players should benefit. While Scarbrough is no exception, he's stuck behind a healthy Johnson plus 2020 second-round pick in rookie D'Andre Swift. All three - and possibly a fourth in rookie fifth-rounder Jason Huntley - may be involved, but Johnson and Swift are the heavy favorites to dominate carries.

Gaskin, a seventh-round pick in last year's draft out of Washington, seemed to be emerging as the cream of that weak crop when his season ended early due to an ankle injury, as he'd piled up 98 rushing yards and a touchdown on 25 carries in Weeks 15 and 16. A little undersized by NFL standards at 5-10, 200, Gaskin's background as a high-school track star makes him dangerous in the open field, and in college he flashed the agility and balance to get through traffic to greener pastures. He's not a decisive runner, however, looking to bounce plays outside too often, and predictably he had more difficulty escaping from NFL tacklers.

He led the team's wideouts in offensive snaps and primarily worked as the No. 2 receiver, finishing the year with 47 catches for 775 yards and five touchdowns. D.J. Chark is clearly atop the depth chart, but Conley's 16.5 yards per reception illustrates his role in the offense. His 52-percent catch rate ranked 188th out of 199 pass catchers with at least 30 targets, so he was a significant boom-or-bust option.

Even a minor improvement to his catch rate could go a long way toward Conley offering more consistent production."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"externalIds":[{"id":"bd01d907-cd57-48cb-9136-5692a4764a20"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":165.375,"formatted":"165.4"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":1.25,"formatted":"1.2"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":10.33125,"formatted":"10.3"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":132.99998,"formatted":"133"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":47.0,"formatted":"47"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":775.0,"formatted":"775"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":8.312499,"formatted":"8.31"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":107,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":41,"formatted":"41"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":220,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":85,"formatted":"WR85","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":5.3,"formatted":"5.3"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":12.27,"formatted":"12.27"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":9.14,"formatted":"9.14"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":132.99998,"formatted":"133"},"seasonAverage":{"value":8.312499,"formatted":"8.31"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.0346794,"formatted":"6.03"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14725,"nameFull":"Mecole Hardman","nameShort":"M.

The 56th overall pick in the 2019 draft scored seven times on 41 targets, including a kick return he brought to the house. He also put up a monstrous 20.7 YPC and 13.1 YPT, league-leading numbers in the unlikely event he were able to maintain that at higher volume. At 5-10, 187, Hardman is small but extremely fast (4.33 40) and is quick and explosive in the open field. He also has the benefit of working with Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes in the league's most high-powered offense. The problem for Hardman is usage - he was only the fourth wideout in an offense that also relies heavily on its tight end (Travis Kelce) and throws to its backs. And the Chiefs re-signed Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson, while Tyreek Hill is an even faster version of Hardman and firmly entrenched as the team's No. 1 option. So why is Hardman ranked this high? Because Watkins has been notoriously injury-prone, Hill himself was seriously injured last year and has had problems off the field, and Robinson is not especially good. Should Hardman take a big step forward in Year 2, or one of those players underperform or get hurt, there's massive upside for a player with his skills in this offense."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"externalIds":[{"id":"fe6dc768-d576-476c-b150-53b85af2a1d1"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":166.5,"formatted":"166.5"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":10.58125,"formatted":"10.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":106.50001,"formatted":"106.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":26.0,"formatted":"26"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":538.0,"formatted":"538"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":6.6562505,"formatted":"6.66"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388593,"name":"The ÜberMinsh","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388593_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":137,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":56,"formatted":"56","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":129,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":49,"formatted":"WR49","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":9.5,"formatted":"9.5"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":3.67,"formatted":"3.67"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":4.64,"formatted":"4.64"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":106.50001,"formatted":"106.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":6.6562505,"formatted":"6.66"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.945268,"formatted":"5.95"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":15251,"nameFull":"Steven Sims","nameShort":"S.

He scored a 65-yard touchdown on an end-around Week 5 and a 91-yard TD on a kick return Week 12, setting the stage for increased playing time once slot specialist Trey Quinn suffered a season-ending concussion in early December. Sims quickly proved to be an upgrade on Quinn, catching 20 of 36 targets for 230 yards and four TDs over the final four weeks of the season. The strong finish should make Sims the favorite for slot work in 2020, but that doesn't mean he won't have any competition - potentially from both Quinn and third-round pick Antonio Gibson. The team claims it wants to use Gibson out of the backfield, but his skill set could also translate to wide receiver, which happens to be a less crowded position in Washington.

Despite his inconsistency, the No. 20 overall pick finished 14th at his position with 704 offensive snaps, benefiting from an utter lack of competition for playing time. Fant's 8.3 YAC average tied Jonnu Smith for the lead among tight ends, albeit with nearly half his 332 after-catch yards coming in two games. Fant caught just one of eight targets traveling 20-plus yards downfield, but he went 12-for-17 on targets of 10-19 yards, proving to be more than just a dump-and-run tight end. And for what it's worth, Fant saw only 14 targets in Drew Lock's five December starts, but the limited chances were efficiently converted to a 10-188-1 receiving line. Incoming draft picks Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler will boost the target competition coming from Denver's wide receivers, while fourth-round TE Albert Okwuegbunam shouldn't be an immediate threat, perhaps profiling as a slightly lesser version of Fant - long on athleticism, short on polish. Courtland Sutton is still the top dog, but a Year 2 breakout for Lock would create room for both Fant and Jeudy to thrive.

The last time we saw him on a football field was Super Bowl LIII, where Gronk had 87 yards on seven targets and set up the game-winning TD with a diving catch between two defenders. But his final year in New England was otherwise disappointing, with the veteran handling his usual every-down role (91.3 percent snap share) and maintaining his per-target efficiency (9.5 YPT) yet drawing only 5.5 passes per game (down from 7.5 in 2017). The Bucs won't necessarily ask Gronkowski to occupy a three-down role, and while a lightened workload might help him stay healthy, it could also prevent a volume rebound. He's no higher than third in the pass-game pecking order, with wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin coming off 1,000-yard seasons. Then there's the matter of 25-year-old tight end O.J. Howard, who flopped hard in 2019 but still has rare physical gifts and a career 10.3 YPT.

Not only did that not happen, but Mayfield sunk to the bottom of the NFL quarterback pool. He ranked 31st in completion percentage (59.4), 31st in interception percentage (3.8), 31st in passer rating (78.8), 30th in bad-pass percentage (23.6) ... and the list goes on. While he certainly played poorly at times, it wasn't all his fault, as a bad offensive line, injuries to key players and questionable game plans dragged him down. It was enough to get coach Freddie Kitchens fired at season's end. New coach Kevin Stefanski, Mayfield's fourth head coach in three seasons, was the offensive coordinator last year for a Vikings team that ranked third in rushing percentage (49.1) and whose quarterback, Kirk Cousins, attempted only 444 passes. But Stefanski was operating under head coach Mike Zimmer's run-first mandate, and while he plans to bring at least the principles of that offense with him, it's unclear if that means Mayfield is destined to lose 100 or so attempts. In any event, Stefanski's zone blocking/play-action scheme should open throwing lanes for Mayfield and widen the pocket. And new offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt said he plans to alter Mayfield's footwork to be more fluid and less robotic. The team also moved to shore up the offensive line by signing RT Jack Conklin and drafting LT Jedrick Wills 10th overall. And Mayfield again has plenty of weapons. Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry had offseason surgeries, but are expected to be healthy for Week 1. Free-agent addition Austin Hooper joins David Njoku at TE, and the backfield might be the league's best with Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. Maybe Year 3 will be Mayfield's breakout season."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"30198d30-9769-4e10-ac86-b4c91d940802"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":223.6875,"formatted":"223.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":0.9375,"formatted":"0.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":14.65625,"formatted":"14.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":225.17998,"formatted":"225.18"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":59.363297,"formatted":"59.4"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3827.0,"formatted":"3,827"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":22.0,"formatted":"22"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":21.0,"formatted":"21"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.073749,"formatted":"14.07"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":29,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":19,"formatted":"19"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":122,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":18,"formatted":"QB18"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":19.06,"formatted":"19.06"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":16.71,"formatted":"16.71"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.83,"formatted":"13.83"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":225.17998,"formatted":"225.18"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.073749,"formatted":"14.07"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.1989765,"formatted":"6.2"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14664,"nameFull":"Kyler Murray","nameShort":"K.

The 2019 first overall pick was the starter from the beginning and didn't seem to be held back by his 5-10 stature. Murray's dual-threat ability helped him finish QB8 in fantasy scoring, as he was second to Lamar Jackson in rushing yards (544) and YPC (5.9) by a quarterback. He also showed mature decision-making, setting an NFL rookie record with 211 consecutive attempts without an interception. Murray's arm proved as strong as advertised too. On attempts longer than 20 yards, he ranked third in the league in both completion percentage (42.6) and YPA (15.5). But the Cardinals didn't regularly try to stretch the field, perhaps due to a lack of weapons. Murray's average depth of target ranked 27th at 7.6 yards, and 55.9 percent of his attempts were no longer than five yards (6th), with a league-high 178 of those targets going to wide receivers. That should change this season with the trade for All-Pro wideout DeAndre Hopkins, who figures to transform the offense. Larry Fitzgerald gives Murray another set of sure hands, and a healthy Christian Kirk should contribute more than he did last season. Plus, Kenyan Drake is a solid receiving threat out of the backfield after the Cardinals dumped David Johnson in the Hopkins deal. How good can Murray be? Well, if he goes 3,500/500 again, he'd be just the third to do it more than once, after the aforementioned Newton and Russell Wilson."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"externalIds":[{"id":"dd5a6b6e-ffae-45a5-b8e6-718a9251f374"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":190.875,"formatted":"190.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":1.4375,"formatted":"1.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":17.915625,"formatted":"17.9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":282.28,"formatted":"282.28"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":64.39114,"formatted":"64.4"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3722.0,"formatted":"3,722"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":20.0,"formatted":"20"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":12.0,"formatted":"12"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":17.6425,"formatted":"17.64"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":12,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":7,"formatted":"7","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":61,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":5,"formatted":"QB5","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":13.0,"formatted":"13"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":14.03,"formatted":"14.03"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":12.87,"formatted":"12.87"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":282.28,"formatted":"282.28"},"seasonAverage":{"value":17.6425,"formatted":"17.64"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.757526,"formatted":"6.76"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13802,"nameFull":"Nick Chubb","nameShort":"N.

He showed impressive power and balance through contact, tying Aaron Jones with a league-high 32 broken tackles on rush attempts, though it was Chubb's speed that really opened eyes. On an 88-yard touchdown run in Week 4, Chubb hit a top speed of 21.95 mph, the fourth-fastest time recorded by a ball carrier in 2019 - the gear he lost when he suffered his devastating knee injury in college apparently has returned. All told, Chubb was fourth in the league with an average of 3.0 yards after contact. Despite his outstanding numbers, with Kareem Hunt still in the fold and around for a full season, it's possible Chubb doesn't match the touch volume he got last year. He averaged 19.3 carries and 22.4 touches in the first eight games of the season, but only 15.2 rushes and 16.4 touches in the final five weeks once Hunt was comfortable in the offense. Workload is the only real concern for Chubb, however, and if the Cleveland attack around him improves, he could see more scoring opportunities to make up for any lost volume."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"4bd60b33-9fbf-4156-ba2b-8264ac37b418"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":110.1875,"formatted":"110.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":12.85625,"formatted":"12.9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":237.2,"formatted":"237.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1494.0,"formatted":"1,494"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":36.0,"formatted":"36"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":278.0,"formatted":"278"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.825,"formatted":"14.82"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":24,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":7,"formatted":"7","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":11,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"RB8","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":4.7,"formatted":"4.7"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":10.5,"formatted":"10.5"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.42,"formatted":"10.42"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":237.2,"formatted":"237.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.825,"formatted":"14.82"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.580902,"formatted":"8.58"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":15539,"nameFull":"Clyde Edwards-Helaire","nameShort":"C.

Selected by the Chiefs at the end of the first round, the dynamic running back moves from one championship squad to another after he helped LSU to an undefeated season in 2019. At 5-7, 207, Edwards-Helaire was widely seen as the best receiving back in this year's draft class, but he's far from one-dimensional as his power, low center of gravity, elusiveness and vision make him difficult to bring to the ground. Another back with a similar skill set, Brian Westbrook, thrived under Andy Reid in Philadelphia, and CEH seems likely to see a significant role right away in Kansas City's supercharged offense, given the draft capital used to acquire him. Damien Williams remains atop the depth chart, but Edwards-Helaire shouldn't need a huge volume of touches to do serious damage in this scheme. Should Williams get hurt again and give the rookie a chance to prove he's capable of carrying the full load, Edwards-Helaire could quickly emerge as a fantasy star."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"externalIds":[{"id":"8aa01565-4481-443a-9951-642c98ded113"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":152.8125,"formatted":"152.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.0625,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":15.61875,"formatted":"15.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":33,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":14,"formatted":"RB14","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15604,"nameFull":"Jonathan Taylor","nameShort":"J.

Taylor is a premier physical specimen, running a 4.39 40 at the combine at a rock-solid 226 pounds. That combination of size and speed allows him to bowl over defenders while also providing a home-run threat. Taylor even showed improvement as a receiver in 2019, and his balance and power through contact make him more than just a scheme-dependent weapon. His hands are a concern, however, both in terms of fumbles - 18 on 968 touches at Wisconsin - and drops. Taylor's mammoth college workload could also impact his shelf life in the NFL, and like many Badger RBs, the patience he developed behind a dominant offensive line won't always serve him well in the NFL. Fortunately, he landed with an Indianapolis squad that has a strong argument for best O-line in the league. The downside of Taylor's new home is that he'll have tough competition for both carries and targets, with Marlon Mack in the mix for the former and Nyheim Hines likely accounting for a good portion of the latter. Taylor should eventually get a big workload, but it isn't clear if that will happen Week 1, midseason or in 2021."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"externalIds":[{"id":"925195a4-06ba-4e37-ae7d-a3d6a5419139"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":165.9375,"formatted":"165.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":17.0,"formatted":"17"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":46,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":20,"formatted":"RB20"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":13776,"nameFull":"Calvin Ridley","nameShort":"C.

At 6-1, 190, Ridley has only average size, and his 4.43 40 speed is above average but nothing special for a player of his frame. Ridley's also a good route runner, capable of lining up in the slot or outside. With Hooper now in Cleveland, Ridley is the clear No. 2 option after 31-year Julio Jones, playing in a pass-friendly system with the capable Matt Ryan at quarterback.

The bad - he missed nearly five games with a shoulder injury and had to play without superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes for two and a half more when he returned. When he played, Hill was his usual superstar self, averaging 9.7 YPT and catching six passes of 40-plus yards on only 89 targets. At 5-10, 185, Hill is small but blazingly fast - 4.24 40 at his pro day - and as dangerous as anyone in the league in open space. He was rarely used in the red zone (seven targets in 11 full games), but he still scored seven times, thanks to his deep-ball prowess and ability after the catch. It's almost unfair one of the league's fastest and most agile receivers would be paired with the quarterback who has the biggest arm and is the best at keeping his focus downfield while escaping the pass rush. Moreover, Hill usually supplements his production with rushing stats, but last year had only 23 yards on eight carries after hurting his shoulder Week 1. With a clean bill of health, don't be surprised if he's more involved again on gadget plays. The only question for Hill at this point is volume. All-world tight end Travis Kelce is still there, Sammy Watkins restructured his contract to stick around and fellow speedster Mecole Hardman could see his role grow. But even on a modest (for his talent) 137 targets in 2018, Hill was the league's WR1 in non-PPR."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"externalIds":[{"id":"01d8aee3-e1c4-4988-970a-8c0c2d08bd83"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":22,"mean":{"value":166.5,"formatted":"166.5"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":10.58125,"formatted":"10.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":159.3,"formatted":"159.3"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":58.0,"formatted":"58"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":860.0,"formatted":"860"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.275001,"formatted":"13.28"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":86,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":30,"formatted":"30"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":9,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"WR3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.1,"formatted":"8.1"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":13.03,"formatted":"13.03"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.34,"formatted":"11.34"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":159.3,"formatted":"159.3"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.275001,"formatted":"13.28"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.296699,"formatted":"8.3"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":14833,"nameFull":"Darius Slayton","nameShort":"D.

He managed career highs for every counting stat besides TDs last year, but the final product nonetheless felt like a disappointment, as he missed four games early in the season and averaged 33 yards in five December appearances. In between, Henry gave us a glimpse of the good stuff, averaging 5.8 catches, 71.2 yards and 0.5 TDs in October and November. His quiet December included just 22 targets, fifth on the team behind Keenan Allen (42), Austin Ekeler (34), Melvin Gordon (29) and Mike Williams (28). Gordon is now out of the picture, but the other three are still around, with Allen and Ekeler being the safe bets for steady volume. It helps that the Chargers have shaky depth at both WR and TE, but even a narrow target distribution won't allow four pass catchers to put up big numbers if quarterbacks Justin Herbert and Tyrod Taylor don't play well. Henry's decision to sign a franchise tag in April at least suggests there won't be any thought given to a contract holdout, though he probably won't be thrilled if he doesn't get a long-term deal before the season."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"705899da-3c20-4bc3-b5d0-2e6e40655131"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":49.875,"formatted":"49.9"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":5.50625,"formatted":"5.5"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":122.700005,"formatted":"122.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":55.0,"formatted":"55"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":652.0,"formatted":"652"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.225,"formatted":"10.23"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":120,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":9,"formatted":"9","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":80,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"TE8","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":12.7,"formatted":"12.7"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":7.2,"formatted":"7.2"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":6.9,"formatted":"6.9"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":122.700005,"formatted":"122.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.225,"formatted":"10.23"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.0034876,"formatted":"6"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":10311,"nameFull":"Jimmy Garoppolo","nameShort":"J.

He also posted the fourth-lowest bad-pass percentage (15.1) as he led the 49ers to the Super Bowl. But he did it barely throwing the ball downfield. He attempted 27 passes longer than 20 yards, fourth fewest among qualified QBs, and his average target depth was just 6.7 yards - only Derek Carr was lower (6.6). But Garoppolo was solid in the red zone with a likely repeatable 21.9 percent TD pass rate. And while the offense lost Emmanuel Sanders in free agency, Deebo Samuel looks poised to prosper in his second year once he recovers from offseason foot surgery. San Francisco also traded up to draft WR Brandon Aiyuk and his 40-inch vertical with the 25th pick. George Kittle remains the main target as one of the top two tight ends in the league, and the backfield has three capable receivers in Raheem Mostert, Tevin Coleman and Jerick McKinnon. Another year removed from an ACL injury could mean more rushing yards for Garoppolo this year too. His floor appears pretty solid.

He signed in the offseason with the Browns, whose new head coach, Kevin Stefanski, was Keenum's position coach in Minnesota in 2017 when the quarterback had the best season of his career. Keenum will back up Baker Mayfield and, presumably, mentor the third-year quarterback, something that seems suited to a journeyman whose on his sixth franchise since entering the league in 2012. If Keenum is forced into action, he could probably hold his own with the Browns' many weapons - Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb, Austin Hooper  - and a rebuilt offensive line that features $42 million free-agent Jack Conklin at right tackle and 10th overall pick Jedrick Wills at left tackle.

In Carolina, he'll be reunited with his college coach Matt Rhule, whose four years at Temple overlapped Walker's time at the school. Along with setting records there, Walker's most recent playing experience saw him lead the XFL in passing yards and passing touchdowns while posting a 5-0 record for the Houston Roughnecks. Those factors figure to give Walker a decent shot against 2019 third-rounder Will Grier to become Rhule's second-string option this season."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0666e6c6-42d9-40ab-83bd-7bbf81e9ac9c"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":272.1875,"formatted":"272.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":2.0625,"formatted":"2.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":24.534374,"formatted":"24.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":14736,"nameFull":"Devin Singletary","nameShort":"D.

He seized the starting job in the second half, however, averaging 92.4 total yards over his final eight games before piling up 134 yards in a wild-card loss to the Texans. While the Florida Atlantic product isn't an impressive physical specimen at 5-7, 203, and doesn't wow anyone with his speed in the open field (4.66 40), he has excellent vision and burst, traits that offensive coordinator Brian Daboll exploited for maximum effectiveness last season, as no back in the league saw eight-man fronts less often than Singletary. He also got better as a receiver as the season wore on, though there's room for further improvement. Buffalo boosted its passing game by trading for Stefon Diggs in the offseason, later adding third-round pick Zack Moss to potentially keep Singletary in a committee, rather than anointing him the Bills' new bell cow. Given Singletary's smaller stature and useful but not exactly elite skill set, that might be the best decision for the team from a football perspective, but it could put a ceiling on his workload and fantasy upside."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"externalIds":[{"id":"a961b0d4-5d7c-438e-90f0-2e1fa09f6c89"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6155,"away":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":7,"mean":{"value":111.3125,"formatted":"111.3"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.7"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":11.65625,"formatted":"11.7"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":130.4,"formatted":"130.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":775.0,"formatted":"775"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":29.0,"formatted":"29"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":194.0,"formatted":"194"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.866666,"formatted":"10.87"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":110,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":32,"formatted":"32"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":65,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":26,"formatted":"RB26"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":5.3,"formatted":"5.3"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.3,"formatted":"11.3"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":130.4,"formatted":"130.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.866666,"formatted":"10.87"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.2907686,"formatted":"5.29"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12761,"nameFull":"Jalen Richard","nameShort":"J.

There were positives, however, as he's largely put the fumbling issues from earlier in his career behind him, and his elusiveness and balance in the open field still made him a big-play threat as a receiver - five of his 36 receptions last season went for at least 20 yards.

Despite his name, Swift's calling card is not elite speed, though he ran a 4.48 in the 40-yard dash at the combine. He mostly relies on a dynamic blend of vision, footwork and football IQ that makes it difficult for the initial defender to bring him down, or even the second or third would-be tackler. Swift seemingly understands how to get the most out of his blockers, and he adds good receiving skills. Like many rookie running backs, he needs to improve his pass protection, and a lack of pile-moving power could deny him short-yardage opportunities, but he nonetheless offers three-down potential long term. It's less clear that he'll actually have that opportunity this season, coming in as the 35th overall pick to a Detroit backfield that already has 2018 second-rounder Kerryon Johnson. The Lions even added another running back in the fifth round - 193-pound Jason Huntley - to compete with Ty Johnson and Bo Scarbrough at the bottom of their depth chart. Swift looks like the closet thing the team has to a complete package in the backfield, but he'll likely be part of a two- or three-man committee at least to begin the season."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"externalIds":[{"id":"cc4b5f58-a11c-4450-a1df-617ad88336e4"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6160,"away":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":127.875,"formatted":"127.9"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.0625,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":14.1625,"formatted":"14.2"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388598,"name":"Make Taylor Swift Chubb Again","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388598_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":68,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":27,"formatted":"RB27"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15770,"nameFull":"Raymond Calais","nameShort":"R.

Samuel should see more receiving work in Year 2 after the 49ers let Emmanuel Sanders walk via free agency, though the team used its first-round pick on the versatile and physical Brandon Aiyuk, who should serve as the deep threat. Jimmy Garoppolo showed he was no Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl, but he's competent enough to support a productive No. 1 receiver alongside Aiyuk and superstar tight end George Kittle, and few receivers will match Samuel's bonus production as a rusher.

At 6-2, 189, Lamb is tall and rangy with elite ball skills and excellent hands. He's elusive after the catch, quick in and out of breaks and dangerous in open space. Despite not being a true burner, he'll make plays down the field by tracking the ball in the air and going over top of smaller defenders. Lamb's route running should improve in the pros, and he has the physical tools and football instincts to be an elite NFL receiver. Landing in Dallas with the 17th pick wasn't ideal - the Cowboys have two established receivers in Michael Gallup and Amari Cooper. But Randall Cobb's 83 targets have left for Houston, the Cowboys had the 10th-most pass attempts last year, and they don't have an established receiving threat at tight end.

The Iowa product quickly justified the selection with 131 yards Week 1 at Arizona, but it turned out the trend he started was tight ends posting big numbers against the Cardinals, rather than his own consistent success. The rookie never had more than 56 yards in a game the rest of the season, seemingly held back by both injuries and his own struggles separating from coverage. On a more positive note, Hockenson's 6.3 YAC average was seventh among TEs, and a 3.4 percent drop rate was good for 12th.

As April's NFL Draft approached, the Patriots' tight end corps was down to Matt LaCosse and Ryan Izzo. It's therefore no surprise that the team doubled-down with a pair of third-rounders, taking Asiasi 91st overall and then selecting Dalton Keene in the No. 101 slot. Both players have some long-term fantasy upside, but with a QB transition on tap in the wake of Tom Brady's departure, it may take some time for either to yield dividends. The 6-3, 257-pound Asiasi showed above-average athleticism at the combine, running a 4.73-second 40-yard dash on a dense frame.

Cousins still had a decent number of downfield attempts - resulting in eight TDs (2nd) - but he relied mostly on a short-passing game based off play action. He completed 73.4 percent (6th) on play action and tied Lamar Jackson for the league lead with 11 TDs, but overall his average depth of target was just 8.1 yards (22nd) as the offense was basically dink-and-dunk with occasional deep shots. In fact, no qualified QB had a lower percentage of attempts in the 11-20-yard range than Cousins (13.5 percent), and he ranked fourth in percentage of attempts within five yards of the line of scrimmage (57.2). Offensive coordinator Keven Stefanski left for the head job in Cleveland, but the offense he called last year belonged to assistant head coach Gary Kubiak - who was named the new OC - so don't expect a departure from the run-first approach. And it's possible the Vikings rely on the running game even more this year after ranking third in rushing percentage last season (49.1). Stefon Diggs, who complained about the lack of passing, was shipped to Buffalo, replaced by Justin Jefferson, the 22nd pick in this year's draft. Jefferson ran a 4.43 40, but if he doesn't develop quickly, the offense will be left without a field-stretcher. Adam Thielen returns, looking to stay healthy after an injury-plagued season. And Cousins has decent targets in TEs Kyle Rudolph and Irv Smith and RB Dalvin Cook. But there's not much after that, especially among the wideouts.

He injured his left foot in preseason and then aggravated the injury Week 2. He didn't play again, ultimately undergoing Lisfranc surgery in December. Newton passed a physical in March for both his foot and right shoulder - a problem the last few years. The Panthers tried to trade him before finally releasing him to save $19 million against this year's salary cap. The COVID-19 pandemic kept Newton in limbo as teams were unable to work him out, and he didn't catch on with his new team, New England, until late June. It's a good landing spot for the 2015 NFL MVP, however. Assuming no lingering injury issues, Newton should overtake sophomore signal-caller Jarrett Stidham once the Patriots return to the field.

The Jets deployed one of the worst offensive lines in the league last year, preventing Bell from showcasing his vaunted patience, and Sam Darnold's September battle with mononucleosis put the whole attack in a hole from which it never really recovered. Coach Adam Gase also seemed unwilling to adjust his scheme to accommodate Bell's skill set. In the end, his 3.2 YPC was better than only Peyton Barber' 3.1 among backs with at least 100 carries, and Bell also finished 26th in broken-tackle rate and 29th in average yards after contact (2.0). Even so, he remained a solid receiving option, and Bell's 5.9 YPT was only slightly worse than his typical output as a Steeler, albeit with less volume. The Jets could look to get out from under his contract sometime soon, but heading into 2020 he remains the top dog in the backfield, ahead of 37-year-old Frank Gore and rookie fourth-round pick Lamical Perine. A rebuilt offensive line could give Bell a little more room to maneuver, and further development from Darnold would provide a boost as well. He'll likely never again see the workload or production he did in Pittsburgh, but Bell might still have another decent campaign or two left in the tank."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"externalIds":[{"id":"7735c02a-ee75-447c-86e6-6c2168500050"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6155,"away":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":129.875,"formatted":"129.9"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.7"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":12.09375,"formatted":"12.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":182.0,"formatted":"182"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":789.0,"formatted":"789"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":66.0,"formatted":"66"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":461.0,"formatted":"461"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.133333,"formatted":"12.13"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":64,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":17,"formatted":"17","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":56,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":24,"formatted":"RB24"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":10.2,"formatted":"10.2"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":10.43,"formatted":"10.43"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.66,"formatted":"10.66"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":182.0,"formatted":"182"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.133333,"formatted":"12.13"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.861377,"formatted":"3.86"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13358,"nameFull":"Matt Breida","nameShort":"M.

Taken with the 14th pick in the 2015 draft, Parker showed glimpses of his potential, but whether it was injuries, playing with subpar quarterbacks or dealing with the whims of coach Adam Gase, something always derailed him. With the competent enough Ryan Fitzpatrick at the helm, Parker went 108-66-1,071-9 over the season's final 13 weeks, numbers that prorate to 133-81-1,318-11 over 16 games. Parker was also efficient with 16.7 YPC (9th) and 9.4 YPT (9th). He had seven catches of 40-plus yards (T-4th) and 21 catches of 20-plus (T-4th) on only 128 targets (13th). Parker was also tied for fourth with nine TDs, despite seeing only modest red-zone work and almost no targets near the goal line (three from inside the 10). He even torched the Patriots' vaunted secondary in Week 17, going 11-8-137 in a game that cost New England a first-round bye. At 6-3, 216, with 4.45 timed speed, Parker is your prototype No. 1 NFL wideout, able to beat defenses downfield and outmuscle defenders in traffic. He'll get 37-year-old Fitzpatrick back and enters the year as the team's undisputed top target with a far less fickle coaching staff, though it's only a matter of time before first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa makes starts under center. Preston Williams (torn ACL) will be back at some point, and tight end Mike Gesicki established himself down the stretch as a red-zone target, but both are likely to be complements rather than competition."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e9ee9209-dd8f-4e4a-be3c-407756a2749c"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":125.875,"formatted":"125.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":6.853125,"formatted":"6.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":210.2,"formatted":"210.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":72.0,"formatted":"72"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1202.0,"formatted":"1,202"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.1375,"formatted":"13.14"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":41,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":7,"formatted":"7","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":51,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":24,"formatted":"WR24"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":17.7,"formatted":"17.7"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":19.5,"formatted":"19.5"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":18.74,"formatted":"18.74"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":210.2,"formatted":"210.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.1375,"formatted":"13.14"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.223907,"formatted":"7.22"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13788,"nameFull":"Michael Gallup","nameShort":"M.

And Gallup left something on the table, dropping 10 of his 113 targets. At 6-1, 198, Gallup has only average size, and his timed speed (4.52 40) is similarly middle of the road. But he's quick, explosive and athletic, and Dak Prescott likes to target his wideouts downfield - both Gallup and Amari Cooper finished top 10 in average depth of target among 100-target WRs. Despite all the big plays, Gallup had only six touchdowns, in large part because he was rarely used in the red zone - only eight targets there all year, and only two were from inside the 10. In fact, Cooper himself saw only nine in the red zone, as the Cowboys passed less when they got in close - Dak Prescott was only 18th in red-zone pass attempts, and tied for 30th in attempts inside the 10, despite being sixth in total attempts. That could change this year with coach Mike McCarthy taking over for Jason Garrett, as Aaron Rodgers was always among the league leaders in red-zone attempts during McCarthy's days in Green Bay. With Cooper re-signing this offseason and CeeDee Lamb drafted in the first round, Gallup will have plenty of competition for Prescott's attention, but Randall Cobb's 83 targets have vacated to Houston, so each of the three receivers could stay busy."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"externalIds":[{"id":"9e174ff2-ca0e-4e6b-96f7-90f0088f7edd"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":154.8125,"formatted":"154.8"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":8.590625,"formatted":"8.6"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":179.70001,"formatted":"179.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":66.0,"formatted":"66"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1107.0,"formatted":"1,107"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.835715,"formatted":"12.84"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":68,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":21,"formatted":"21","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":66,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":29,"formatted":"WR29"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":30.3,"formatted":"30.3"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":14.57,"formatted":"14.57"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.08,"formatted":"13.08"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":179.70001,"formatted":"179.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.835715,"formatted":"12.84"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.4049754,"formatted":"7.4"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":10295,"nameFull":"Davante Adams","nameShort":"D.

His touchdowns dipped, but over his last eight games, including the playoffs, he scored seven times. Adams has never been especially efficient, and last year was no exception - 12.0 YPC and 7.9 YPT. At 6-1, 215, Adams is stoutly built, runs good routes and has a great rapport with Aaron Rodgers. In fact, Adams is the only target Rodgers has seemed to trust since Jordy Nelson left town three years ago. But Adams uncharacteristically had eight drops last year (in 12 games), and with his modest speed (4.56 40) he's not a major threat to stretch the field - only 12 catches of 20-plus and two for more than 40 yards last year. The Packers lack wideout depth beyond Adams, so he'll be the unquestioned top target again, and at age 27, he's still squarely in his prime and virtually certain to get a large share of the red-zone work. Rodgers isn't what he once was, but he's still well above the threshold for supporting one of the league's top fantasy receivers."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"e7d6ae25-bf15-4660-8b37-c37716551de3"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":170.4375,"formatted":"170.4"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":10.675,"formatted":"10.7"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":170.20001,"formatted":"170.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":83.0,"formatted":"83"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":997.0,"formatted":"997"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":14.183334,"formatted":"14.18"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":77,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":24,"formatted":"24"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":8,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"WR2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":18.8,"formatted":"18.8"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":18.23,"formatted":"18.23"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":16.24,"formatted":"16.24"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":170.20001,"formatted":"170.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":14.183334,"formatted":"14.18"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.791346,"formatted":"5.79"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14706,"nameFull":"DK Metcalf","nameShort":"D.

Metcalf's numbers were solid enough - 15.5 YPC, 9.0 YPT and four catches of 40-plus on only 100 targets - but they don't include the wild-card game when he torched the Eagles for 160 yards and a score. What stands out most about Metcalf is his freakish size/speed combination - think Terrell Owens with more speed, or Julio Jones with more muscle. At 6-4, 229, and running a 4.33 40, Metcalf is off the charts athletically, and his 40.5-inch vertical leap and 134-inch broad jump show his explosiveness. He'll never be the quick-in-and-out-of-breaks slot type, but that hardly matters when you can run past, jump above and overpower the unlucky defender who happens to be assigned to you. Metcalf is also ideally built for red-zone work - 18 targets last season - and likely will get more work from in close during his second season. It also helps to be paired with one of the league's elite quarterbacks in Russell Wilson, who routinely makes downfield throws after escaping the pocket, though it hurts that the Seahawks are so run-heavy (23rd in pass attempts). Moreover, Tyler Lockett is still around as a co-No. 1, and the Seahawks acquired tight end Greg Olsen this offseason."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"externalIds":[{"id":"754faf0f-40f7-45f0-b23b-6ce990ecaf26"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6156,"away":{"abbreviation":"SEA","location":"Seattle","name":"Seahawks"},"home":{"abbreviation":"ATL","location":"Atlanta","name":"Falcons"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":164.875,"formatted":"164.9"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":10.40625,"formatted":"10.4"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":158.1,"formatted":"158.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":58.0,"formatted":"58"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":900.0,"formatted":"900"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.88125,"formatted":"9.88"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":90,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":32,"formatted":"32"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":44,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":21,"formatted":"WR21","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":17.1,"formatted":"17.1"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.23,"formatted":"9.23"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":9.4,"formatted":"9.4"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":158.1,"formatted":"158.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.88125,"formatted":"9.88"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.7243137,"formatted":"5.72"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13023,"nameFull":"George Kittle","nameShort":"G.

He couldn't quite match his tight end yardage record from 2018, but Kittle was the furthest thing from a slouch last season, ranking 12th among pass catchers in yards per game (75.2) and 14th in yards per target (9.8). His average target depth dropped from 7.3 yards to 5.7, and while there was a corresponding dip in yards per reception, Kittle's catch rate shot up to elite territory at 79.4 percent. He may not get the same downfield opportunities as Travis Kelce, but Kittle is even better than his TE counterpart at picking up yards after the catch, and the 26-year-old also had lower drop rates in both 2018 and 2019. Kittle's greatest weaknesses - at least from a fantasy standpoint - are actually strengths from the 49ers' perspective. He plays too hard, he blocks too much and sometimes he can be too invested in tasks that don't produce stats. Kittle has missed only three games in three seasons, but he's played through a torn shoulder labrum, fractured rib cartilage and a bone spur in his ankle. That probably makes Kelce the safer TE1 choice, but Kittle is the one with superhuman talent."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"2ada91b0-036e-454f-83c3-6d939ff584a9"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":73.3125,"formatted":"73.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":11.66875,"formatted":"11.7"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":179.0,"formatted":"179"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":85.0,"formatted":"85"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1053.0,"formatted":"1,053"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.785714,"formatted":"12.79"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":70,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":18,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"TE2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":12.8,"formatted":"12.8"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":16.03,"formatted":"16.03"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":13.24,"formatted":"13.24"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":179.0,"formatted":"179"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.785714,"formatted":"12.79"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.441095,"formatted":"5.44"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":1431,"nameFull":"Matt Schaub","nameShort":"M.

Specifically, a hip dislocation suffered last November. Tagovailoa was given medical clearance for football activities in March, but the extent of his recovery is uncertain. Durability is about the only question with Tagovailoa, who also had surgery on both ankles, sprained his right knee, fractured his left index finger and suffered a concussion during his three-year stint at Alabama. The lefty's dual-threat skills are plenty evident, getting top marks from scouts for his accuracy and decision making. (Indeed, at Alabama he threw 87 touchdowns to a mere 11 interceptions in 32 games.) At 6-0, he doesn't have ideal height, but gone are the days when short stature is held against a quarterback, especially one who is mobile outside the pocket and possesses a strong arm with a quick release.  Ryan Fitzpatrick is expected to start, but Tagovailoa could ease into the job later this season, provided his hip checks out. Fitzpatrick turns 38 in November, and Tua is the future. Any rookie quarterback is a risk (especially behind an offensive line as weak as the Dolphins'), but Tagovailoa has the skills that portend fantasy upside."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"26ad9c27-de38-495e-913c-6fb2428e76d3"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":199.25,"formatted":"199.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":13.125,"formatted":"13.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388644,"name":"Les belles brebis"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":240,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":33,"formatted":"QB33","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true},{"proPlayer":{"id":15581,"nameFull":"Jalen Hurts","nameShort":"J.

But Wentz is injury prone having missed eight games in four seasons (and was knocked out of the Eagles' wild card game last year), so it wouldn't surprise if the 6-1 Hurts gets some time under center this season. In the meantime, he can continue to develop as a passer, as he already has the mobility to kill defenses on the run. Hurts, who ran a 4.59 40 at the combine (second fastest among QBs), set a school record as a freshman at Alabama with 954 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. As a grad-school transfer to Oklahoma last season, he was a Heisman Trophy finalist after rushing for 1,298 yards and 20 touchdowns. The knock on Hurts was his accuracy and arm strength, but he completed 69.7 percent of his passes last season (7th in nation) with 32 TDs and eight INTs and then wowed scouts at the combine with his downfield passing. Still, if Wentz stays healthy, he won't see much action, other than perhaps a Taysom Hill-like role. If Wentz gets injured, though, Hurts can at least use his legs to extend plays.

Signed in the offseason by the Chiefs to battle for a depth role, Hyde instead got flipped to the Texans in August after Lamar Miller tore an ACL, becoming the early down back in coach Bill O'Brien's unimaginative offense. With Duke Johnson handling passing-down work, Hyde spent almost the entire season banging for yards in the trenches, and no back in the league ran the ball more times between the tackles than Hyde (137), while only Gus Edwards and Le'Veon Bell took a lower percentage of their carries outside. Given the circumstances, his 4.4 yards per carry and 2.2 yards per carry after contact were surprisingly good numbers, as he used his size (6-0, 229) and power to muscle through the holes Houston's rebuilt offensive line opened. The team did not bring him back, however, and he signed with Seattle where he will add depth to a backfield looking for healthy bodies. Both Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny are coming off season-ending injuries, and the latter is not expected to be ready for Week 1. Hyde could figure into a steady role behind Carson, though the Seahawks also drafted DeeJay Dallas in the fourth round and still have Travis Homer, who took over late last season after Carson and Penny went down.

The former Raider and Viking still possesses good speed in the open field - a key asset in a Saints offense adept at scheming players open - but his skill set doesn't stand out in any other area, and he managed a meager 1.7 yards after contact per carry, fifth lowest in the league.

He's not a natural receiver, and while that didn't stop Jacksonville from force-feeding targets to Fournette last year, new offensive coordinator Jay Gruden might have other ideas, especially with Chris Thompson now on the roster to handle third downs.

In their defense, the wideout was hobbled by an ankle injury that eventually required surgery, so we probably shouldn't hold his meager production with the team against them. But even a healthy Sanu is at best a competent possession receiver, someone who reliably catches short passes and rarely makes big plays - only three catches of 20-plus yards last year, seven in 2018. With Tom Brady gone, the Patriots will turn to either late-June acquisition Cam Newton or untested Jarrett Stidham at quarterback.

Of course, it took the fourth-most pass attempts in NFL history (675) - and Antonio Brown - to accomplish the big stat line two years ago. Roethlisberger was not especially effective throwing downfield, nor in the red zone, in 2018. In short, his career year was all built on volume. That's not likely to be the scenario this year - Roethlisberger has had only one other season in his 16-year career with 600 attempts  (and Brown is long gone). What Roethlisberger has going for him, though, is a good collection of skill players to target. No. 1 receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster should bounce back after being victimized last season by injury and Big Ben's truly awful replacements. Wideouts Diontae Johnson and James Washington showed promise despite a dire passing game, and rookie second-round pick Chase Claypool is a 6-4 wide receiver who runs a 4.42 40. The Steelers also signed Eric Ebron to team with Vance McDonald at tight end, while a committee backfield is led by James Conner, who averaged 4.9 yards per touch and scored six touchdowns in the first eight weeks of last season before injuries destroyed his second half. If it's not obvious, health is the biggest factor for the offense, and especially for the 38-year-old Roethlisberger, who is expected to be ready for the season opener. But without rushing yards to pad his stats, and likely far fewer attempts than the last time we saw him, Roethlisberger is now probably more QB2 than QB1."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"ea357add-1a41-4a8b-8f34-bbfade7f4d98"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6165,"away":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600125300000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":278.75,"formatted":"278.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":25,"mean":{"value":1.875,"formatted":"1.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":23.78125,"formatted":"23.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":11.74,"formatted":"11.74"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":56.451614,"formatted":"56.5"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":351.0,"formatted":"351"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":5.87,"formatted":"5.87"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":398,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":53,"formatted":"53","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":117,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"QB15"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.87,"formatted":"5.87"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":5.87,"formatted":"5.87"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":11.74,"formatted":"11.74"},"seasonAverage":{"value":5.87,"formatted":"5.87"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":2.8700001,"formatted":"2.87"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":10315,"nameFull":"Derek Carr","nameShort":"D.

And like the year before, Carr ran up his numbers thanks to a dink-and-dunk passing game that rarely tried to stretch the field. A league-high 61.4 percent of Carr's attempts were within five yards of the line of scrimmage, with just 7.2 percent going beyond 20 yards. No surprise, his 6.6-yard average depth of target was the lowest in the NFL. In Carr's defense, the Raiders intended for Antonio Brown to be their deep threat, but that plan blew up in training camp. And Tyrell Williams, who has a career 16.1 YPC, dealt with plantar fasciitis for much of the year. The big winner was TE Darren Waller with a team-high 117 targets. He'll be back for more this season, as will the promising Hunter Renfrow. And with a healthy Williams on the outside opposite 12th overall pick Henry Ruggs, who runs a 4.27 40, Carr theoretically has the weapons to exploit defenses. But on a team that ranked eighth in rushing percentage (44.2)  - and with an RB in Josh Jacobs who will see north of 250 carries - Carr's volume isn't likely to increase much (513 last year). With no scrambling threat, his upside is limited, especially if he reverts to checkdowns again. The Raiders also made Marcus Mariota the highest-paid backup in the league, so the leash on Carr appears shorter than ever."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"externalIds":[{"id":"9f026fc0-4449-4dc5-a226-2e2830619381"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":249.625,"formatted":"249.6"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":1.3125,"formatted":"1.3"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":19.49375,"formatted":"19.5"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":240.36,"formatted":"240.36"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":70.37037,"formatted":"70.4"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4054.0,"formatted":"4,054"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":21.0,"formatted":"21"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":15.0225,"formatted":"15.02"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":22,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"15"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":171,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":28,"formatted":"QB28","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":18.64,"formatted":"18.64"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":18.82,"formatted":"18.82"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":17.04,"formatted":"17.04"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":240.36,"formatted":"240.36"},"seasonAverage":{"value":15.0225,"formatted":"15.02"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.4264574,"formatted":"5.43"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12892,"nameFull":"Christian McCaffrey","nameShort":"C.

With Cam Newton out most of the year, CMac became the unquestioned focal point of the Panthers' attack, racking up a dizzying 403 touches and topping 100 receptions for the second consecutive campaign. He wasn't just an open-field weapon, though. McCaffrey saw 20 carries inside the 5-yard line, good for second in the NFL, and that goal-line usage led to a career-high 15 rushing TDs. The question heading into 2020 is how much that workload will affect his efficiency. McCaffrey's elite elusiveness and speed have allowed him to avoid a lot of big hits, and he has yet to miss a game in his career, but the history of running backs coming off massive workloads is checkered at best. Even within the context of last year he showed a possible weakness, as he managed just 1.8 YPC after contact, ninth fewest among qualified rushers and a drop from the 2.1 he posted in 2018. That said, Carolina's new-look offense with Teddy Bridgewater under center and former Saints assistant Joe Brady as coordinator should be just as committed to getting McCaffrey the ball in optimal situations, and the front office didn't make him the highest-paid running back in the NFL without expecting plenty of production in return."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"f96db0af-5e25-42d1-a07a-49b4e065b364"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":129.3125,"formatted":"129.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.0625,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":12.03125,"formatted":"12"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":412.19998,"formatted":"412.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1387.0,"formatted":"1,387"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":116.0,"formatted":"116"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1005.0,"formatted":"1,005"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":19.0,"formatted":"19"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":25.762499,"formatted":"25.76"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":1,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":1,"formatted":"1","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":1,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":1,"formatted":"RB1","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":19.3,"formatted":"19.3"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":25.87,"formatted":"25.87"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":22.06,"formatted":"22.06"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":412.19998,"formatted":"412.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":25.762499,"formatted":"25.76"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.231126,"formatted":"9.23"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":15563,"nameFull":"Cam Akers","nameShort":"C.

Akers is also a capable receiver, catching 30 of 42 targets for 225 yards and four scores last season. With Todd Gurley off to Atlanta, Akers has an opportunity to make an immediate impact.

The running back sat out ...","description":"Gordon's holdout for a big contract extension proved to be one of the poorer decisions in the league last year. The running back sat out the first four games of the season before reluctantly returning, and when the Chargers showed no interest in bringing him back this year, he wound up signing a two-year deal with the Broncos that was worth less than what the Bolts originally had offered him. Once he returned to the fold, Gordon saw his fewest touches per game since his rookie season, as Austin Ekeler had proven himself capable of handling a larger workload, and Gordon's performance did not warrant more volume anyway. In fact, his broken tackle rate (38th) and average yards after contact (1.9, 34th) both ranked near the bottom of the league, in the same range as the man he is supplanting in the Denver backfield, Royce Freeman. Gordon will find himself in a similar timeshare with his new team, splitting reps with Phillip Lindsay, but at the very least should enjoy better play from his offensive line, something he needs to make full use of his speed in the open field. A few big games should be on the horizon, but expecting consistent production from him week to week might be asking too much."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0f8ccece-d663-4069-944b-f318f64c60b7"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":133.3125,"formatted":"133.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":14.78125,"formatted":"14.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":158.8,"formatted":"158.8"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":612.0,"formatted":"612"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":42.0,"formatted":"42"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":296.0,"formatted":"296"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.233334,"formatted":"13.23"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":87,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":23,"formatted":"23"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":41,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":18,"formatted":"RB18","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":21.2,"formatted":"21.2"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":15.27,"formatted":"15.27"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":14.94,"formatted":"14.94"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":158.8,"formatted":"158.8"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.233334,"formatted":"13.23"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.5602746,"formatted":"6.56"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12051,"nameFull":"Tyler Boyd","nameShort":"T.

But Boyd's success came at a cost to his efficiency - from 13.5 YPC and 9.5 YPT in 2018 to 11.6 and 7.1, respectively. Part of that goes with the territory of being the undisputed top receiver (A.J. Green missed the entire year rather than just some of it), and part of that was playing three games with a backup quarterback. Moreover, even when Andy Dalton was under center the offensive line was one of the worst in the league, putting a damper on the entire passing game. This year, things should be different. For starters, Green will be back after receiving the franchise tag, so Boyd likely will be a co-No. 1 rather than the only game in town. The Bengals also drafted superstar QB prospect Joe Burrow with the first overall pick and wideout Tee Higgins at No. 33. Burrow is more mobile than Dalton, and should make more plays behind what's likely - if only by regression to the mean - to be an improved O-line. But Higgins is yet another mouth to feed in the offense, and given his pedigree and draft slot, likely to be involved as a rookie. At 6-2, 203, and running a 4.58 40, Boyd's physical tools don't jump out, but he's a polished route runner in the prime of his career, and we'd expect him to be Burrow's security blanket even if Green, erratic speedster John Ross, Higgins and/or Auden Tate all get a piece of the receiving pie."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"externalIds":[{"id":"76a5edec-5ff7-49fa-a8ec-5768a372279d"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6161,"away":{"abbreviation":"LAC","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Chargers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CIN","location":"Cincinnati","name":"Bengals"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600027500000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":3,"mean":{"value":128.9375,"formatted":"128.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":7.525,"formatted":"7.5"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":177.9,"formatted":"177.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":90.0,"formatted":"90"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1046.0,"formatted":"1,046"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.11875,"formatted":"11.12"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":71,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":23,"formatted":"23","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":71,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":32,"formatted":"WR32"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.4,"formatted":"8.4"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":13.93,"formatted":"13.93"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.38,"formatted":"13.38"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":177.9,"formatted":"177.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.11875,"formatted":"11.12"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.3072066,"formatted":"7.31"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13806,"nameFull":"Christian Kirk","nameShort":"C.

Then the Cardinals traded for DeAndre Hopkins. On a per-play basis, Kirk's 2019 numbers were poor - 10.4 YPC (29th among the league's 30 100-target receivers) and 6.6 YPT (28th). And he made few big plays - only six catches of 20-plus yards and one-catch of 40-plus. His 10 carries for 93 yards gave him a small boost, but he saw only 12 red-zone looks all year and scored a paltry three times. At 5-11, 200, Kirk has merely average size and decent speed (4.47 40). He's quick enough to handle the slot, though Larry Fitzgerald and Hopkins will probably see snaps there, potentially forcing Kirk out wide. Kirk is still slated to be the second receiver after Hopkins, with the 37-year old Fitzgerald getting some short looks, and this should be one of the higher volume passing attacks in the league. With Kyler Murray likely to improve in Year 2, Kirk has a good chance to contribute."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"externalIds":[{"id":"ebcd87ce-218c-4144-810b-921c2f59d6e8"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6162,"away":{"abbreviation":"ARI","location":"Arizona","name":"Cardinals"},"home":{"abbreviation":"SF","location":"San Francisco","name":"49ers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":131.875,"formatted":"131.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":134.2,"formatted":"134.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":68.0,"formatted":"68"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":709.0,"formatted":"709"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.323076,"formatted":"10.32"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":106,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":40,"formatted":"40"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":93,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":39,"formatted":"WR39"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":10.1,"formatted":"10.1"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":6.37,"formatted":"6.37"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":7.16,"formatted":"7.16"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":134.2,"formatted":"134.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.323076,"formatted":"10.32"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.135503,"formatted":"8.14"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":9891,"nameFull":"Adam Thielen","nameShort":"A.

Thielen proved he was back in the playoffs with a 9-7-129 line against the Saints, so the injury shouldn't concern us much heading into 2020. Thielen's been efficient for years - before his injury-plagued 2019 he had posted at least 9.0 YPT every season since 2016, and even last year was above that mark prior to the injury. At 6-2, 200, Thielen has decent size, runs crisp routes and rarely drops a pass. He also has above-average speed - he ran a 4.49 40 at his 2013 pro day and had eight catches for 40-plus yards in 2017-18. Thielen also saw plenty of red-zone use those two years, particularly targets from inside the 10-yard line (16 in that span), though that was with former offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, and last year the Vikings had Kevin Stefanski in that role. This season, Thielen and the Vikings offense will undergo more changes. Gary Kubiak, last year's assistant head coach, will take over as OC, likely adding his own twist to the zone-blocking West Coast offense. Stefon Diggs, Thielen's main competition for targets the last four years, left via free agency and was replaced by first-round pick Justin Jefferson. As such, Thielen is the probable target leader in what should be an above-average offense, though at age 30, his skills are probably slightly past their peak."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"externalIds":[{"id":"2fa2b2da-4aa9-44b5-b27e-56876dfe2ad4"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6152,"away":{"abbreviation":"GB","location":"Green Bay","name":"Packers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"MIN","location":"Minnesota","name":"Vikings"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":156.0,"formatted":"156"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.8"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":9.192187,"formatted":"9.2"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":99.399994,"formatted":"99.4"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":30.0,"formatted":"30"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":418.0,"formatted":"418"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.94,"formatted":"9.94"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":147,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":61,"formatted":"61","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":31,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":13,"formatted":"WR13","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":0.2,"formatted":"0.2"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":1.57,"formatted":"1.57"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.68,"formatted":"5.68"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":99.399994,"formatted":"99.4"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.94,"formatted":"9.94"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.649879,"formatted":"8.65"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":6126,"nameFull":"Jared Cook","nameShort":"J.

The late-career transition from disappointment to pleasant surprise has partially been a matter of team context in Oakland and now New Orleans, with the first locale bringing prolific volume and the second offering frequent TD opportunities. Cook also seems to have become better after the catch, with his YAC averages the last two seasons (5.9, 5.4) equaling or besting his marks from every year since 2011. Drops remain a source of frustration, but it's a tolerable price for a TE who averages 12-plus YPC year after year, especially after he added career highs for YPT and TDs in 2019. The problem, of course, is that Cook saw just 65 targets in 14 games, relying on efficiency that's probably unsustainable long term, even in a Drew Brees-Sean Payton offense. The show will continue to run through Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, while offseason addition Emmanuel Sanders is a threat to overtake Cook as the third option.

He lost his starting job for good the following week and took just five more snaps the rest of the season as Ryan Tannehill led the Titans to the AFC championship game. Mariota's Titans tenure ended in March when he signed a two-year $17.6 million deal with the Raiders that made him the highest-paid backup in the league. He enters the season as the No. 2 to Derek Carr, but that's a big contract to simply hold a clipboard and it wouldn't surprise if he pulled a Tannehill - the underachieving free-agent looking for a new start who pushes out the lackluster incumbent. But Carr won't be as easy to dislodge. He's a highly efficient QB - even if it's built on dink-and-dunking - who takes care of the ball (eight INTs on 513 attempts last year). Plus, he's under contract through 2022. If Mariota gets his chance, though, he'll have a better supporting cast than he's ever had. Tyrell Williams is healthy, Hunter Renfrow showed promise in his rookie year and TE Darren Waller had a breakout season. The team drafted speedster Henry Ruggs (4.27 40) 12th overall, and 1,150-yard rusher Josh Jacobs returns ready for more passing-down work.

He simply doesn't have the power to shake off would-be tacklers, and he wound up gaining a lower percentage of his yards after contact than any back with 200-plus carries besides Christian McCaffrey.

The Falcons' scheme and banged-up offensive line did him no favors, but Freeman also failed to do much with his chances as his 1.6 yards per carry after contact was second lowest in the league among qualified running backs. While he still has the vision to spot creases in a defense, he no longer has the quickness or burst to get through them in time, and given his history of lower-body injuries, that lost step probably isn't coming back. The Falcons elected to cut Freeman in March to save a little more than $3 million in cap space, replacing him with Todd Gurley, and the NFL teams in need of backfield help generally weren't shy about using draft capital on the position.

The 2018 third-round pick remained stuck behind Phillip Lindsay on the depth chart and saw his production on the ground stagnate, but Freeman showed improvement as a receiver out of the backfield and saw a significant spike in targets as a result. His best games came when Joe Flacco was under center, however, and he didn't garner as many looks from Drew Lock the final five weeks of the season once the youngster took over at quarterback. Freeman's ability to handle passing downs could keep him involved in a limited capacity, but the offseason addition of Melvin Gordon leaves the 24-year-old a distant third in the battle for touches. Freeman needs an injury ahead of him to regain a large role in the offense."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"externalIds":[{"id":"82f459c4-bf23-4d60-9eb6-b062994f5517"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":133.3125,"formatted":"133.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":21,"mean":{"value":14.78125,"formatted":"14.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":120.7,"formatted":"120.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":496.0,"formatted":"496"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":43.0,"formatted":"43"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":256.0,"formatted":"256"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":7.54375,"formatted":"7.54"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":124,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":39,"formatted":"39","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":213,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":70,"formatted":"RB70","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":0.9,"formatted":"0.9"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":5.4,"formatted":"5.4"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":6.16,"formatted":"6.16"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":120.7,"formatted":"120.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":7.54375,"formatted":"7.54"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.806898,"formatted":"3.81"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":14759,"nameFull":"Tony Pollard","nameShort":"T.

The rookie quickly proved he could make a big impact when he got the chance, erupting for 128 yards and a touchdown on only 16 touches Week 3 against the Dolphins. He later topped that performance Week 15 against the Rams, piling up 143 yards and a score on 14 touches. Those two games accounted for more than half his rushing yards for the season, however, as he saw six touches or fewer in half of the Cowboys' games. Pollard's blend of speed, elusiveness and surprising power made him tough to bring down, and among backs who got at least 80 carries last season, he led the league with 3.6 yards per carry after contact. He also flashed some ability as a receiver, increasing the ways in which offensive coordinator Kellen Moore could get him involved. As long as Elliott is healthy, Pollard doesn't figure to take many carries, but the second-year pro is at least capable of efficient production when game flow works in his favor."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"externalIds":[{"id":"33b0227d-4c21-4e71-b4cd-be35f7db9123"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":131.0625,"formatted":"131.1"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":13.9875,"formatted":"14"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":81.7,"formatted":"81.7"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":455.0,"formatted":"455"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":15.0,"formatted":"15"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":107.0,"formatted":"107"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":5.835714,"formatted":"5.84"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":175,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":51,"formatted":"51","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":139,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":49,"formatted":"RB49","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":8.77,"formatted":"8.77"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":6.26,"formatted":"6.26"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":81.7,"formatted":"81.7"},"seasonAverage":{"value":5.835714,"formatted":"5.84"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.2931094,"formatted":"7.29"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":11724,"nameFull":"Malcolm Brown","nameShort":"M.

His 255 rushing yards were only nine more than his prior high, but the back who came into 2019 with only one career rushing TD managed to rack up five last year, all from within the 5-yard line. Brown's new goal-line vulture role didn't earn him any fans among Gurley's fantasy owners, but it might be the best fit for his talent, as Brown offers enough power and burst to muscle through a tackler or two but won't make any of them miss. Last year's third-round pick, Darrell Henderson, could see a bigger role with Gurley now in Atlanta, but the bigger threat to Brown's meager production is 2020 second-round pick Cam Akers.

While Harris doesn't have White's hands or route-running prowess, the third-round pick out of Alabama does possess a skill set that could allow him to eventually thrive as a versatile option in Bill Belichick's offense if he gets the chance - a chance that might come as soon as this season if Sony Michel fails to make an impact once again in the lead role. It's possible that Tom Brady's departure could force the team to lean even more heavily on its ground game, opening up touches for Harris even if he isn't starting.

Three years later, he enters the NFL as a third-round draft pick still fighting the same battle, with his long-term position unclear. He primarily played wide receiver for the Wildcats, even making the Biletnikoff Award watch list last summer. But when injuries knocked out Kentucky's top two quarterbacks early last season, Bowden pushed the coaching staff to let him take over as the signal-caller, and he went on to pile up 1,468 rushing yards and 13 TDs as a zone-read QB who rarely threw the ball. A hamstring strain prevented Bowden from working out at the 2020 combine, but he claims to consistently run the 40yard dash in the 4.4-4.5 range. The Raiders view him as a running back for the time being, with the potential to eventually shift to wide receiver if things don't work out so great in the backfield. As for the immediate future, it isn't quite clear how Bowden fits into the Vegas offense, where Josh Jacobs is locked in as the lead back and passing-down specialist Jalen Richard has a two-year, $7 million contract that includes $3.4 million guaranteed. The Raiders might consider a gadget role and the return game as options to put the ball in Bowden's hands as a rookie."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"externalIds":[{"id":"bd783f2e-b931-4d3e-ab71-60fa1431f598"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":150.0,"formatted":"150"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":2.0625,"formatted":"2.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":17.925,"formatted":"17.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388883,"name":"Trade Addicts","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388883_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":270,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":90,"formatted":"RB90","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":10263,"nameFull":"John Brown","nameShort":"J.

At 5-11, 178, Brown is small, but he can fly - 4.34 40 speed at the 2014 NFL Combine - and he's paired with a quarterback who has the arm to find him downfield. Unfortunately, Josh Allen isn't especially accurate, and he often looks to run on broken plays rather than keeping things alive to strike for the big throw.

While his per-play numbers were pedestrian - 11.5 YPC, 7.4 YPT - Johnson was paired with two of the league's worst quarterbacks, yet still managed to score five touchdowns and catch two passes for 40-plus yards on 92 targets, mostly lining up outside. At 5-10, 183, and with a below-average 40 time (4.53), he has about the same physical specs as Antonio Brown, and like Brown, Johnson is quick and explosive. The Steelers have been wizards at developing smaller young receivers - from Santonio Holmes to Mike Wallace to Brown to Emmanuel Sanders - and Johnson could be the next in line, especially with Ben Roethlisberger healthy again. But Smith-Schuster, who already has Roethlisberger's trust, should be the clear No. 1, and Johnson will compete with 2018 second-round pick James Washington, 2020 second-round pick Chase Claypool and tight ends Vance McDonald and Eric Ebron for second fiddle.

The good news is he's had plenty of time off, and he's completely healthy, but he's managed to play full seasons only twice in a 12-year career. At 5-10, 175, Jackson is small and slight but blazing fast, and he doesn't seem to have lost much. Even in three games last year, he averaged 17.7 YPC, 15.9 YPT and hauled in two long bombs of 40-plus. Jackson should again serve as Carson Wentz's primary deep threat, no matter what the Eagles decide to do with Alshon Jeffery, and in any event rookie Jalen Reagor is a decent bet to lead the wideout group in targets. But Jackson's role is so specific to him and his target ceiling capped that health and not team context should be the most relevant predictor of his output.

Ebron actually improved to 7.2 YPT last year, but the drops (11.8 percent) got even worse, reminiscent of his Detroit days. Nagging injuries were a factor, as his season ended in November when he decided to have surgeries on both ankles. A lengthy rehab process didn't scare away the Steelers, who handed Ebron a twoyear, $12 million contract. The 27-year-old received medical clearance in May and doesn't expect to miss any practice time this summer.

His completion percentage increased by six points, but at 58.8 percent still ranked last in the NFL, and while his bad-pass percentage was no longer the league's lowest, it merely improved to bottom 10 at 22.1 percent. At 6-5, 237, Allen has a cannon arm, but he is among the league's least effective deep passers. He attempted 63 throws longer than 20 yards last season, completing just 15 as only Kyle Allen (23.1) and Mason Rudolph (23.6) had lower downfield completion percentages than Allen's ugly 23.8. That's partly why his average depth of target ranked seventh at 9.5 yards while his YPA ranked 25th at 6.7. Allen's decision-making improved, though. After throwing seven interceptions in the first five games, he threw just two more the rest of the way. But he continued to fumble at a high rate, fortunate to lose only five of 14. Allen is too quick to take off in the face of pressure, but the rushing stats elevate his fantasy upside - among quarterbacks since 1970, only Cam Newton had more rushing touchdowns (22) in his first two years than Allen's 17. The Bills acquired wide receiver Stefon Diggs to help with Allen's deep passing, and he still has speedster John Brown, effective slot man Cole Beasley and a promising young tight end in Dawson Knox. Given his rushing numbers, if Allen gets the passing game going, he could jump into the top 5 of fantasy quarterbacks."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"externalIds":[{"id":"3069db07-aa43-4503-ab11-2ae5c0002721"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6155,"away":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":250.0625,"formatted":"250.1"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":17,"mean":{"value":1.5625,"formatted":"1.6"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":20.06875,"formatted":"20.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":278.56003,"formatted":"278.56"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":58.785248,"formatted":"58.8"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3089.0,"formatted":"3,089"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":20.0,"formatted":"20"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":17.410002,"formatted":"17.41"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":13,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"8","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":72,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":7,"formatted":"QB7","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":0.2,"formatted":"0.2"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":12.39,"formatted":"12.39"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":13.89,"formatted":"13.89"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":278.56003,"formatted":"278.56"},"seasonAverage":{"value":17.410002,"formatted":"17.41"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.322186,"formatted":"7.32"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12894,"nameFull":"Patrick Mahomes","nameShort":"P.

Namely, he was even more lethal downfield last season than in 2018, leading the league in passer rating, touchdowns and TD percentage (min. 30 attempts) on throws longer than 20 yards. He improved his TD rate by 6.6 percentage points (12.2 to 18.8) on deep throws, and his rating jumped by nearly 30 points as he cut his interceptions from sixth most (7) to sixth fewest (2). Overall, Mahomes had 96 fewer attempts thanks to a dislocated knee that cost him two and a half games. Prorated to the 580 attempts he had in 2018, he'd still approach 5,000 yards. The biggest regression was in touchdown passes, largely because of his performance in the red zone. His red-zone TD pass rate fell from 36.5 percent to 19.6, his TD passes from 35 to 11. Considering the league rate last year was 23.2 percent, a healthy Mahomes should do better near the goal line this season. Mahomes also has perhaps the league's best collection of skill players, including a trio of speedy wideouts in Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins and Mecole Hardman, while tight end Travis Kelce kills defenders underneath and up the seam. The Chiefs also added first-round pick Clyde Edwards-Helaire, considered the best receiving back in this year's draft. And, of course, aggressive play caller Andy Reid is always willing to take shots and chuck the ball around. In two seasons as starter, Mahomes has a league MVP and a Super Bowl MVP. It shouldn't surprise anyone if he wins either - or both - again this season."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"externalIds":[{"id":"11cad59d-90dd-449c-a839-dddaba4fe16c"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6151,"away":{"abbreviation":"HOU","location":"Houston","name":"Texans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"KC","location":"Kansas City","name":"Chiefs"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1599783600000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":280.8125,"formatted":"280.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":2.0625,"formatted":"2.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":24.2,"formatted":"24.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":286.04,"formatted":"286.04"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":65.90909,"formatted":"65.9"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4031.0,"formatted":"4,031"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":26.0,"formatted":"26"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":5.0,"formatted":"5"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":20.431429,"formatted":"20.43"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":9,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":6,"formatted":"6","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":23,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":1,"formatted":"QB1","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.06,"formatted":"11.06"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":19.73,"formatted":"19.73"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":18.52,"formatted":"18.52"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":286.04,"formatted":"286.04"},"seasonAverage":{"value":20.431429,"formatted":"20.43"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.9564137,"formatted":"6.96"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13778,"nameFull":"Saquon Barkley","nameShort":"S.

Arguably the greatest big-play threat in the league, Barkley averaged 5.2 yards a carry in the six games following the Giants' bye to close out the season, and despite only being in top shape for about half the year he still recorded five gains of at least 40 yards while finishing eighth in rushing yards after contact (605). At 5-11, 233, Barkley's unreal blend of power, speed, elusiveness and receiving skill is basically unparalleled, but he's needed every ounce of that talent working behind an offensive line that was awful in 2018, and merely below average last season. With No. 4 overall pick Andrew Thomas boosting the O-line and QB Daniel Jones potentially improving, Barkley might finally have a supporting cast worthy of his talent. New OC Jason Garrett knows how to feed a bell cow from his days in Dallas - Ezekiel Elliott has averaged nearly three more touches per game than Barkley in their respective careers - so volume should not be an issue. Don't be surprised if Saquon's rookie production ends up being his baseline rather than his ceiling."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"externalIds":[{"id":"9811b753-347c-467a-b3cb-85937e71e2b9"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6165,"away":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600125300000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":128.0,"formatted":"128"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":0.4375,"formatted":"0.4"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":8.91875,"formatted":"8.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":217.09999,"formatted":"217.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":1003.0,"formatted":"1,003"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":52.0,"formatted":"52"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":438.0,"formatted":"438"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":16.699999,"formatted":"16.7"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":36,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":10,"formatted":"10","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":2,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"RB2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":19.2,"formatted":"19.2"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":29.8,"formatted":"29.8"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":22.12,"formatted":"22.12"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":217.09999,"formatted":"217.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":16.699999,"formatted":"16.7"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.994847,"formatted":"9.99"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12101,"nameFull":"Kenyan Drake","nameShort":"K.

The Bears offense was a disaster in 2019, as an injury-plagued offensive line and regression from Mitchell Trubisky constantly put the running game in poor situations and forced Montgomery to dance for yards that weren't there. He finished seventh among qualified rushers in broken tackle rate and T-6th in broken tackles (28), so he proved adept at making the first man miss. The problem was the three or four other defenders who were there a split second later, as his average of 1.6 yards after contact was fourth lowest in the league, sandwiching him between Peyton Barber and Sony Michel. Montgomery's early down role in tandem with Tarik Cohen seems secure, while the overall outlook remains cloudy. The addition of Bill Lazor as Chicago's new offensive coordinator seems geared toward improving the passing game, as does the team's decision to trade for Nick Foles to compete with Trubisky under center, and the offensive line could be even worse following the retirement of Kyle Long.

Despite seeing only 84 ...","description":"As a 22-year-old rookie, Brown was the best per-play wide receiver in the NFL last year. Despite seeing only 84 targets from the combination of Marcus Mariota and Ryan Tannehill, Brown led all rookie receivers in yards and tied Darius Slayton with eight TDs. Brown's 12.5 YPT was first among the league's 52 80-target wideouts, and his eight catches of 40 yards also tied for first. And that doesn't include a 49-yard rushing TD, the icing on the cake. At 6-0, 226, Brown is a physical mismatch for most defensive backs. He's wide, strong and explosive, and his 4.49 speed makes him dangerous after the catch once the initial defender fails to bring him down. Brown also showed excellent hands with only two drops all year. While he has ideal red-zone size, he was rarely used there - only eight targets - yet he scored nine times. The biggest issue for Brown is opportunity. Coach Mike Vrabel and OC Arthur Smith ran an offense that finished last season with the second fewest pass attempts (448). That probably caps Brown's ceiling, as it's hard to see him among the league leaders in targets, especially with 2017 fifth overall pick Corey Davis, slot man Adam Humphries and emerging TE Jonnu Smith in the fold. But the team re-upped Tannehill, the QB with whom Brown had the most success, and if anything happens to Derrick Henry, whom the team franchise-tagged in March, the sky's the limit for Brown."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"a9e580f2-1fbe-46fb-887c-c84089b507e4"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":7,"mean":{"value":138.4375,"formatted":"138.4"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":14,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":8.95625,"formatted":"9"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":190.09999,"formatted":"190.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":52.0,"formatted":"52"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1051.0,"formatted":"1,051"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.881249,"formatted":"11.88"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":57,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"15","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":30,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":12,"formatted":"WR12","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":20.4,"formatted":"20.4"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":18.87,"formatted":"18.87"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":18.74,"formatted":"18.74"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":190.09999,"formatted":"190.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.881249,"formatted":"11.88"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.837224,"formatted":"8.84"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14746,"nameFull":"Terry McLaurin","nameShort":"T.

Despite catching passes from an overmatched Dwayne Haskins and a backup-quality Case Keenum, the rookie averaged 15.8 YPC (7th among the league's 40 90-target WR), 9.9 YPT (5th) and scored seven times in only 14 games. At 6-0, 210, McLaurin is stout for his height, and he ran a blistering 4.35 40 at the 2019 combine while showcasing a 37.5-inch vertical and 125-inch broad jump. He's already emerged as one of the NFL's better downfield threats - his average depth of target was 13.8 yards (8th) as he piled up 1,287 air yards on only 93 targets. Washington rarely used McLaurin in the red zone - only 13 targets there all season, and seven from inside the 10 - but that could change soon with new coach Ron Rivera and offensive coordinator Scott Turner taking over. In any event, McLaurin has little competition as the team's top option. Steve Sims and Kelvin Harmon are the highest-ranked returnees on the depth chart, while third- and fourth-round picks Antonio Gibson and Antonio Gandy-Golden, respectively, will also battle for targets. The biggest factor for 2020 will be Haskins' development. He was terrible for his first seven games last year, but played better in his final two. Haskins doesn't need to be great for a receiver of McLaurin's talents to thrive, but he'll have to sustain a base level of competence."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"7e8c4641-2beb-4213-ba22-69fe0307005f"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6157,"away":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"home":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":175.5625,"formatted":"175.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":1.5,"formatted":"1.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":12.532812,"formatted":"12.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":162.90001,"formatted":"162.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":58.0,"formatted":"58"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":919.0,"formatted":"919"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.635715,"formatted":"11.64"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":83,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":27,"formatted":"27"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":48,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":22,"formatted":"WR22","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":12.1,"formatted":"12.1"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":15.77,"formatted":"15.77"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":11.76,"formatted":"11.76"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":162.90001,"formatted":"162.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.635715,"formatted":"11.64"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.936508,"formatted":"6.94"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":6636,"nameFull":"Emmanuel Sanders","nameShort":"E.

But this offseason he signed a two-year deal with the Saints to pair with Drew Brees and play second fiddle to Michael Thomas. At 5-11, 180, Sanders is small but quick, and he's always had decent long speed (4.41 40 at the 2010 combine). But at 33, he's almost certainly lost half a step, and it's unclear how he'll slot into the New Orleans offense. Deep threat Ted Ginn is gone, but third-year man Tre'Quan Smith is younger and probably at least as fast as Sanders at this stage of their respective careers. Moreover, Thomas is a target hog, tight end Jared Cook earned Brees' trust late last year, and tailback Alvin Kamara gets a lot of looks out of the backfield.

Of course, it was also the league's most run-heavy offense, which explains how he fell a tick shy of triple-digit targets despite accounting for 23 percent of the team total in his 15 active games (he sat out a meaningless Week 17 contest). Andrews was a true statistical anomaly, finishing fourth among TEs in target share and fifth in total targets but only 35th in snaps (467, 44.2 percent share). It might be argued that the modest snap counts actually worked in his favor, with Andrews handling minimal blocking work while regularly taking the field for passing downs. On the other hand, there were at least two or three games where his modest workloads appeared to be related to nagging foot, ankle or knee injuries. With no report of surgery being needed during the offseason, Andrews is locked in as one of the preferred targets for reigning MVP Lamar Jackson, who enters his age-23 season with the potential for continued development as a passer. Andrews probably can't sustain the outrageous per-snap production from last season, but he can make up the difference with more playing time now that former backup Hayden Hurst is off to Atlanta and out of the Ravens' picture."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0618f387-9b72-4270-8b8f-dec4cccc9e4a"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":50.375,"formatted":"50.4"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":0.625,"formatted":"0.6"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":7.975,"formatted":"8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":174.2,"formatted":"174.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":64.0,"formatted":"64"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":852.0,"formatted":"852"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.613333,"formatted":"11.61"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":74,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":4,"formatted":"4","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":24,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"TE3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":24.3,"formatted":"24.3"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":13.13,"formatted":"13.13"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.48,"formatted":"11.48"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":174.2,"formatted":"174.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.613333,"formatted":"11.61"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.1108246,"formatted":"7.11"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":6324,"nameFull":"Brian Hoyer","nameShort":"B.

The Patriots' patient approach to their post-Tom-Brady quarterback situation might be interpreted as a sign of confidence in Stidham, who was sharp last preseason but only saw mop-up duty (four pass attempts, one pick-six) once the games counted."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"externalIds":[{"id":"582fe465-135a-4901-beef-60aebce99067"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":272.0625,"formatted":"272.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":32,"mean":{"value":2.4375,"formatted":"2.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":24.5375,"formatted":"24.5"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":-1.6400001,"formatted":"-1.64"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":50.0,"formatted":"50.0"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":14.0,"formatted":"14"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":-0.5466667,"formatted":"-0.55"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":580,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":72,"formatted":"72","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":263,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":36,"formatted":"QB36","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":-0.2,"formatted":"-0.2"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":-0.55,"formatted":"-0.55"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":-0.55,"formatted":"-0.55"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":-1.6400001,"formatted":"-1.64"},"seasonAverage":{"value":-0.5466667,"formatted":"-0.55"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":0.6369371,"formatted":"0.64"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":15733,"nameFull":"Cole McDonald","nameShort":"C.

He recorded strong numbers in both his red shirt freshman and sophomore seasons, tallying over 8,000 passing yards and 70 touchdowns combined. However, he'll face a steep transition to the NFL after facing a relatively low level of competition in college -- a challenge only enhanced by this year's altered offseason. McDonald will also have to overcome a hitch in his throwing motion, something he's already worked to correct during his college career. Overall, McDonald is likely in for an uphill battle to be the primary backup to Ryan Tannehill in 2020, though his athleticism should help his case to stick as a viable backup in future seasons."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"externalIds":[{"id":"2d907c0c-cf4e-4564-b9eb-560d84f16144"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":238.875,"formatted":"238.9"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":6,"mean":{"value":1.1875,"formatted":"1.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":18.203125,"formatted":"18.2"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15748,"nameFull":"Tommy Stevens","nameShort":"T.

At 35, he doesn't have the breakaway speed he used to, but he still has enough power and vision to keep the chains moving and snap off the occasional chunk play. His performance since joining the team has been even more remarkable when you factor in the wretched state of the offense around him, as Washington finished 31st in total yards last year and 28th the year before while cycling through starting QBs. That chaos caused coach Jay Gruden to lose his job, but Peterson kept his, sticking around as an insurance policy for new coach Ron Rivera, who takes over a team that saw starting running back Derrius Guice play only five games the last two seasons. There is a lot of competition for backup work, between rookie thirdround pick Antonio Gibson, 2019 fourth-round pick Bryce Love and veteran free-agent additions J.D. McKissic and Peyton Barber.

The team attempted 131 fewer passes than it had the year before, with Hines seeing 23 fewer targets, and while his overall efficiency with those looks was comparable, he dropped five passes. When everything is clicking in Frank Reich's offense, Hines can use his 4.38 track-star speed to do damage in the open field, but his lack of size (5-9, 196) and/or vision limits his utility as a runner and prevents him from taking advantage of the elite offensive line he works behind. As a result, he didn't get many snaps outside of obvious passing downs in his first two seasons. The good news is that a similar role could bring bigger rewards this year, considering QB Philip Rivers turned a parade of Chargers scatbacks into useful fantasy players the last decade. 2020 second-round pick Jonathan Taylor could wind up claiming a bell-cow role in time, but as a rookie he's a bigger threat to Marlon Mack's spot on early downs."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"externalIds":[{"id":"ed5bcd2c-6335-4c0b-93b7-2116684a9b02"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6153,"away":{"abbreviation":"IND","location":"Indianapolis","name":"Colts"},"home":{"abbreviation":"JAC","location":"Jacksonville","name":"Jaguars"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":165.9375,"formatted":"165.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":17.0,"formatted":"17"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":95.899994,"formatted":"95.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":199.0,"formatted":"199"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":44.0,"formatted":"44"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":320.0,"formatted":"320"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":5.9937496,"formatted":"5.99"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":150,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":44,"formatted":"44","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":160,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":53,"formatted":"RB53","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":7.1,"formatted":"7.1"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":7.47,"formatted":"7.47"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":7.18,"formatted":"7.18"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":95.899994,"formatted":"95.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":5.9937496,"formatted":"5.99"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.3480368,"formatted":"3.35"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":13870,"nameFull":"Chase Edmonds","nameShort":"C.

Edmonds offers three-down potential, combining good power, vision and elusiveness with soft hands, and while he lacks breakaway speed, he's still dangerous in the open field. Avoiding injuries has been an issue for Edmonds dating to college, however, so while he's already demonstrated he can be a weapon as the lead back in short bursts, he's better suited to a depth role than a full-time starting gig.

Smith has a reasonably well-rounded skill set and runs with surprising power for a small back, but he doesn't have breakaway speed or electric moves in the open field. With the Falcons swapping out Devonta Freeman for Todd Gurley as their lead back this offseason, Gurley's ongoing knee problems open the possibility of Smith finding his way to a lead role.

Fitzgerald actually had an uptick in efficiency for him - 10.7 YPC, 7.4 YPT - but is mostly a big-bodied, slow-moving possession receiver with excellent hands. Fitzgerald did have four catches of 40-plus yards last year in Kliff Kingsbury's offense, as many as he'd had in the previous seven years combined, but we'd treat that as an anomaly. With Hopkins in town, Fitzgerald will be hard pressed to continue his 16-season streak of 100 targets - Christian Kirk is also around, and the team gave Fitzgerald only 109 last year in 16 games without Hopkins.

At 6-3, 190, with blazing 4.37 40 speed and a 37-inch vertical leap, Anderson has the physical specs to be a star. His per-play production was modest with the Jets due to below-average QB play and coaching, but he rarely dropped a pass (only three in his last 190 targets), and averaged 15.0 yards per catch the last two years.

His per-play averages in 10 games were also disappointing, though - a career-low 10.1 YPC and 6.9 YPT. That said, the 40th overall pick in 2016 is slated to be a prominent part of the offense, sharing the slot with Golden Tate and lining up outside opposite Darius Slayton. At 5-10, 201, Shepard is stout, quick and has above-average speed (4.48 40), but he's not a big-play type (only six catches for 40-plus in his entire career and none last year). Two tailwinds for the entire Giants passing game are a risk-taking young quarterback who can buy time with his legs to throw downfield and a below-average defense that's likely to provide some beneficial game flow. Shepard's a competent and reliable player when healthy, so he should be involved, but the exact pecking order among Shepard, Tate and Slayton has yet to be established in Jason Garrett's offense."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"externalIds":[{"id":"1ffc735b-74d8-44d2-ab32-00c5485c799f"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6165,"away":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600125300000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":139.3125,"formatted":"139.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":0.8125,"formatted":"0.8"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":7.440625,"formatted":"7.4"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":113.299995,"formatted":"113.3"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":57.0,"formatted":"57"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":576.0,"formatted":"576"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.33,"formatted":"11.33"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":128,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":50,"formatted":"50","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":113,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":47,"formatted":"WR47"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":6.4,"formatted":"6.4"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":12.87,"formatted":"12.87"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.14,"formatted":"11.14"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":113.299995,"formatted":"113.3"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.33,"formatted":"11.33"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.6430593,"formatted":"5.64"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12106,"nameFull":"Demarcus Robinson","nameShort":"D.

At 6-0, 205, Campbell has average size, but he ran a scorching 4.31 40 at the 2019 combine and posted elite marks in the vertical (40 inches), broad jump (135 inches) and 20-yard shuttle (4.03), making him one of the best athletes in a deep and talented receiver class. Campbell wasn't polished as a route runner coming out of college, so for now he lacks football skills commensurate with his athletic talent, but he should improve with more experience.

The question is how many looks he'll see as a wideout. At 6-1, 206, he has decent size but only average long speed (4.50 40), though his vertical leap (40 inches) and broad jump (128 inches) were near the top of his class. Aiyuk is excellent after the catch, able to make defenders miss, and he finishes off plays like a running back. His fate will likely depend on his work before the catch, however - getting off the line of scrimmage and running strong routes. Luckily, he landed in an almost ideal setting - the Niners let Emmanuel Sanders go this offseason, leaving only Deebo Samuel ahead of Aiyuk on the receiver depth chart.

As a result, Peoples-Jones does have an opportunity to climb up Cleveland's depth chart as the 2020 season rolls along."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"924edb03-29a9-42ae-92dd-ef7e8a498095"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":159.625,"formatted":"159.6"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":10,"mean":{"value":8.75,"formatted":"8.7"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":13216,"nameFull":"Blake Jarwin","nameShort":"B.

Undrafted three years ago, Jarwin essentially took a redshirt in 2017 and was quiet through most of 2018, failing to take advantage of Witten's brief retirement prior to a three-TD explosion Week 17. Any thought of it carrying over to 2019 took a tumble when Witten announced his return, but Jarwin did well with the work he saw, catching 75.6 percent of his targets while averaging 11.8 YPC. Jarwin signed a four-year, $22 million deal this offseason, and the TE depth behind him is limited to Dalton Schultz, Blake Bell and Cole Hikutini - a trio with 53 combined NFL catches. Granted, competition for Dak Prescott's attention will be fierce, with CeeDee Lamb replacing Randall Cobb in an offense that already has Ezekiel Elliott, Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup. The Cowboys were 11th in TE target share (21.9 percent) last season, but between Lamb's presence and a new coaching staff, Jarwin will really need to shine to keep that number near 20 percent."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"externalIds":[{"id":"43e8a6ac-d451-4dbd-b145-797764f91494"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":55.8125,"formatted":"55.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":24,"mean":{"value":6.78125,"formatted":"6.8"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":69.00001,"formatted":"69"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":31.0,"formatted":"31"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":365.0,"formatted":"365"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":4.6000004,"formatted":"4.6"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388894,"name":"Better Call Saul","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388894_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":201,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":28,"formatted":"28"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":145,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":19,"formatted":"TE19"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"formatted":"0"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":2.3,"formatted":"2.3"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":3.36,"formatted":"3.36"},"duration":5}],"seasonTotal":{"value":69.00001,"formatted":"69"},"seasonAverage":{"value":4.6000004,"formatted":"4.6"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":3.377967,"formatted":"3.38"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":14806,"nameFull":"Kaden Smith","nameShort":"K.

He lingered at the bottom of the Giants' depth chart for a couple months after he was claimed on waivers, eventually landing in the starting lineup after Rhett Ellison and Evan Engram suffered season-ending injuries. Smith responded with 30 catches for 267 yards and three touchdowns in his six starts, averaging 6.8 targets while playing at least 91 percent of snaps in each game. Smith was essentially a competent dump-off target and nothing more, which actually is pretty good for a rookie at a position with a steep learning curve.

The Jets are counting on his second year in coach Adam Gase's offense going more smoothly than last year when an early season bout with mononucleosis cost him three games. It took Darnold some time to get on track once he returned as he threw nine interceptions (to five TDs) in his first four games back. But in the second half of the season he made great strides, throwing 13 touchdowns and four interceptions and increasing his YPA by more than a yard (7.3 vs. 6.2) over the first half as the Jets went 6-2. If Darnold is to take the next step, though, he has to improve his deep-ball accuracy. Last season, he completed only 25.0 percent of his attempts longer than 20 yards, 29th of 32 qualified QBs. His 9.2 YPA on those throws was 26th. He also was ineffective on play action, ranking 29th in YPA, 31st in completion percentage and last in passer rating. Perhaps he'll get more time behind a rebuilt offensive line after taking 33 sacks in 13 games last year. The Jets signed three linemen and drafted 6-7, 364-pound LT Mekhi Becton 11th overall. Darnold, whose fantasy upside is capped by a lack of rushing, lost field-stretcher Robby Anderson in free agency, but the Jets signed Breshad Perriman and drafted WR Denzel Mims, who boasts both size (6-3) and speed (4.38 40). With the exception of Kyler Murray, the 23-year-old Darnold is still younger than every projected starting quarterback this season, including No. 1 pick Joe Burrow. Even so, with the division as wide open as it's been in years, it's go time for Darnold."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"externalIds":[{"id":"13d826c5-9b22-4e0a-a877-02d8c84c546b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6155,"away":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":213.8125,"formatted":"213.8"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":0.9375,"formatted":"0.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":4,"mean":{"value":15.159375,"formatted":"15.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":181.15999,"formatted":"181.16"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":61.904762,"formatted":"61.9"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":3024.0,"formatted":"3,024"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":19.0,"formatted":"19"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":13.0,"formatted":"13"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":13.935384,"formatted":"13.94"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":66,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":27,"formatted":"27","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":167,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":27,"formatted":"QB27","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.76,"formatted":"8.76"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":10.73,"formatted":"10.73"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":11.75,"formatted":"11.75"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":181.15999,"formatted":"181.16"},"seasonAverage":{"value":13.935384,"formatted":"13.94"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":8.324216,"formatted":"8.32"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":12920,"nameFull":"Leonard Fournette","nameShort":"L.

A physical runner who prefers going through tacklers rather than around them but still possesses breakaway speed in the open field, the LSU product posted the highest yards per carry of his career despite the struggles of the offensive line, but it was his shocking volume through the air - 100 targets that really stood out. Fournette saw nearly double the number of targets per game that he had through his first two NFL seasons, and he was one of only four running backs in the league to finish with triple-digit targets, joining Christian McCaffrey, Austin Ekeler and Tarik Cohen. At first glance, that group seems like the football version of the Sesame Street game, \"One of These Things (Is Not Like the Others).\" Of course, there are a few reasons to believe Fournette's target volume won't carry forward. His two biggest target games came when Nick Foles started, not Gardner Minshew, and new offensive coordinator Jay Gruden likely plans to use old Washington friend Chris Thompson on passing downs.

When he's in top form, the Tennessee product remains one of the most electric open-field runners in the league and one of the top receiving threats out of the backfield, and he's remarkably hauled in exactly 81 passes in each of his three seasons. Before the injuries began to slow him, Kamara was right on pace for another brilliant campaign, averaging 7.1 yards per target through his first six games but only 4.3 YPT over his last nine, including the playoffs. Kamara's secret weapon has always been his surprising power and sturdiness as a rusher at 5-10, 215. Even in a season when he was often performing at less than 100 percent as he gutted out his injuries, he led the league in broken tackle rate with one for every 5.9 carries.

Johnson can still provide decent speed in the open field and strong receiving skills, but he finished 44th in broken-tackle rate in 2018 and would've been 30th last season if he had taken enough carries to qualify.

On only 121 targets, he put up an 86-1,333-9 line, leading 100-target receivers with 11.0 YPT. (Kenny Golladay was a distant second at 10.3). Godwin didn't catch many deep balls (three grabs of 40-plus), but he led the league with 25 catches of 20 or more yards in only 14 games. And while he also didn't see much red-zone work (14 targets, T-21st), he was tied for fourth with 10 inside-the-10 targets. As a result, only Golladay and Cooper Kupp caught more touchdowns. At 6-1, 209, Godwin is big for the slot, where he usually lines up, and he has good speed (4.42 40). He's also quick, explosive and has excellent hands (one drop last year). The biggest issue for Godwin is Tom Brady replacing the erratic but highly productive Jameis Winston. While Winston led the NFL with 30 interceptions, he also had 33 TDs and 5,109 yards, making him an ideal option for his receivers' fantasy output, despite being far less than that for the Buccaneers. While Brady in his age-43 season will make fewer mistakes and likely lean heavily on Godwin out of the slot, he'll also take fewer risks, which likely means fewer big plays for both Godwin and co-No. 1 Mike Evans. Moreover, should un-retired tight end Rob Gronkowski stay healthy, he'll siphon some of last year's targets from the wide receivers, particularly in the red zone. But coach Bruce Arians will almost certainly have a more open attack than last year's receiver-depleted Patriots, and a prime-age, 24-yearold Godwin should be in line for another big season, especially if Brady defaults to short, quick throws like he did the last few years."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"baa61bb5-f8d0-4f90-bbe2-028576b8d33d"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6163,"away":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":175.0625,"formatted":"175.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":1.3125,"formatted":"1.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":11.0859375,"formatted":"11.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":233.1,"formatted":"233.1"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":86.0,"formatted":"86"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1333.0,"formatted":"1,333"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":9.0,"formatted":"9"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":16.65,"formatted":"16.65"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":26,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":14,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":5,"formatted":"WR5","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":14.6,"formatted":"14.6"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":11.4,"formatted":"11.4"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":16.06,"formatted":"16.06"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":233.1,"formatted":"233.1"},"seasonAverage":{"value":16.65,"formatted":"16.65"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.383175,"formatted":"9.38"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":10252,"nameFull":"Mike Evans","nameShort":"M.

At 6-5, 231, Evans is massive for a receiver, and he has enough speed (4.53 40) to create the moderate amount of separation he needs. Evans also got his share of red-zone work - 17 looks in only 13 games, including nine targets from inside the 10 (T-10th) and seven from inside the 5 (T-2nd). The big question for 2020 is how Tom Brady's presence will affect Evans and teammate Chris Godwin. While Jameis Winston was a mediocre real-life quarterback, he was great for the fantasy prospects of his top receivers, especially a deep threat like Evans. Brady rarely threw the deep ball the last few years in New England, and at age 43, he has below-average arm strength. That said, Brady hasn't had a receiver like Evans since Randy Moss, and Brady had no problem getting Moss the ball downfield 10 years ago. The other question is how the team integrates newly acquired, newly unretired tight end Rob Gronkowski, who at press time is expected to share the position with O.J. Howard and Cameron Brate. If Gronkowski stays healthy, he should cut into Evans' red-zone work at the very least. But No. 3 WR Breshad Perriman left for the Jets, so there should be some extra targets freed up there, and the Bucs should have a pass-heavy offense in any event. Evans missed the last three games of 2019 with a hamstring injury, but he's expected to be 100 percent healthy for training camp."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"c48c21d9-0ae5-478c-ad34-30a660cfa9b8"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6163,"away":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":175.0625,"formatted":"175.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":1.3125,"formatted":"1.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":27,"mean":{"value":11.0859375,"formatted":"11.1"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":199.2,"formatted":"199.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":67.0,"formatted":"67"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1157.0,"formatted":"1,157"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":15.323076,"formatted":"15.32"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":52,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":12,"formatted":"12","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":22,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"WR8","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":12.6,"formatted":"12.6"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":8.97,"formatted":"8.97"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.2,"formatted":"9.2"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":199.2,"formatted":"199.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":15.323076,"formatted":"15.32"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":12.369638,"formatted":"12.37"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12950,"nameFull":"JuJu Smith-Schuster","nameShort":"J.

First, his quarterback, ...","description":"With Antonio Brown gone, Smith-Schuster was poised for a huge role in Year 3, but just about everything went wrong. First, his quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, made it through only a game and a half before an elbow injury knocked him out for the year. The combination of Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges was below average even for backups, and Smith-Schuster suffered a knee injury in Week 11 that cost him four and a half games. As a result, it's hard to make much of his 2019 numbers. Smith-Schuster still managed 13.1 YPC and 8.0 YPT and had two catches of 40-plus yards on only 69 targets, so there's nothing alarming there, even under terrible circumstances. At 6-1, 215, Smith-Schuster is stout for a wideout, and while his timed speed at the combine was nothing special (4.54 40) he's made big plays ever since he got into the league (13 catches of 40-plus yards in two and a half full seasons). Roethlisberger is set to return, claiming he's throwing without pain for the first time in years, but Smith-Schuster has a little more competition for targets than he did a year ago - last year's third-round pick Diontae Johnson showed promise, third-year man James Washington also came on in the season's second half and the team drafted WR Chase Claypool in the second round. That said, Smith-Schuster, still only 23, is easily the most accomplished receiver on the squad and the only one with whom Roethlisberger has a rapport. Smith-Schuster's price in 2020 could be the cheapest it'll be for the next five years."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"9547fbb1-0d4f-4d9e-83b9-e2fa30463bb9"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6165,"away":{"abbreviation":"PIT","location":"Pittsburgh","name":"Steelers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NYG","location":"New York","name":"Giants"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600125300000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":180.75,"formatted":"180.8"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":29,"mean":{"value":11.34375,"formatted":"11.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":92.2,"formatted":"92.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":42.0,"formatted":"42"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":552.0,"formatted":"552"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":7.683333,"formatted":"7.68"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":157,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":65,"formatted":"65","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":32,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":14,"formatted":"WR14","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.6,"formatted":"1.6"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":2.63,"formatted":"2.63"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":3.38,"formatted":"3.38"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":92.2,"formatted":"92.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":7.683333,"formatted":"7.68"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.9590044,"formatted":"5.96"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":11177,"nameFull":"Amari Cooper","nameShort":"A.

In his first full season as a Cowboy, he managed 15.1 YPC (8th) and 10.0 YPT (3rd). He had six catches of 40-plus yards (T-6th) and scored eight touchdowns (T-12th) despite seeing only 119 targets (18th) and nine looks in the red zone. At 6-1, 210, and with 4.42 speed, Cooper has the size to overpower smaller defensive backs and the speed to get down the field. Moreover, since Cooper's arrival, Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott went from being a competent game manager to one of the league's leading passers. And Cooper, who signed a five-year, $100 million contract with the Cowboys in March, is just 26 years old and still firmly in the prime of his career. Third-year man Michael Gallup (113 targets in 14 games) actually saw more targets per game than Cooper, and the team drafted super prospect CeeDee Lamb with the 17th overall pick, so Cooper's not the only show in town. Fortunately, Randall Cobb (83 targets) left for Houston, and Prescott was sixth in the league in attempts last year, so there's enough to go around for all three players. And both Gallup and Cooper should see an uptick in red-zone targets under new coach Mike McCarthy."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"externalIds":[{"id":"00f88be8-45f9-4237-b2b8-3271ec790d07"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":154.8125,"formatted":"154.8"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":0.875,"formatted":"0.9"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":8.590625,"formatted":"8.6"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":207.0,"formatted":"207"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":79.0,"formatted":"79"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1189.0,"formatted":"1,189"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.9375,"formatted":"12.94"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":45,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":9,"formatted":"9","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":25,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":9,"formatted":"WR9","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.8,"formatted":"11.8"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":6.2,"formatted":"6.2"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":9.68,"formatted":"9.68"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"isOnTradingBlock":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":207.0,"formatted":"207"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.9375,"formatted":"12.94"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":9.371091,"formatted":"9.37"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12891,"nameFull":"O.J.

Alas, NFL teams aren't as accommodating as fantasy leagues, which is why the Buccaneers finally cut bait. Winston, who fumbled 12 times and lost five in addition to his 30 interceptions, led the league with 35 giveaways (by 12), second most in the NFL since 1992. He is the only quarterback in NFL history other than Fran Tarkenton to win the passing yardage crown and throw at least 30 interceptions. Tarkenton had the good sense to retire after he did it, making Winston the first QB since 1979 to not to return to the team with whom he won the passing title the year before. Winston is now the backup in New Orleans on one-year deal that gives him a chance for career reboot under the tutelage of Drew Brees and coach Sean Payton. Perhaps playing in the Saints system will improve his decision making, as it relies on short-to-intermediate high-percentage throws, rather than airing it out - Winston attempted a league-leading 152 passes longer than 15 yards last season; the Saints attempted exactly half that. Winston also had corrective eye surgery in the offseason for nearsightedness, which at least means he'll be able to read the scoreboard now (not that eye surgery is foolproof). But even if Brees gets hurt, there's no guarantee Winston would get the snaps with Taysom Hill itching for a bigger role.

Fitzpatrick enters this season the likely starter until fifth overall pick Tua Tagovailoa is ready.

Before that, though, he'll have 1,200-yard WR DeVante Parker and 6-6 TE Mike Gesicki to target, among others. And he'll reunite with Chan Gailey, the Dolphins' new offensive coordinator who was Fitzpatrick's head coach with the Bills (2010-12) and OC with the Jets (2015-16).

His YPA declined nearly a yard and a half to 6.1 - a half yard less even than his rookie mark. His average depth of target dropped from 9.7 yards (4th) to 8.3 yards (20th), while his 8.8 YPA on attempts longer than 20 yards ranked 29th. And despite nearly 100 more attempts, he threw seven fewer TD passes. Trubisky's rushing even took a sharp decline, dropping from 421 to 193 yards. So, it wasn't surprising when the Bears declined his fifth-year option and traded for Nick Foles to compete for the starting job. While the team said both quarterbacks will get equal reps in training camp, Foles might be the favorite as he reunites with head coach Matt Nagy, offensive coordinator Bill Lazor and QB coach John DeFilippo, each of whom he has played for at his various stops. Even if Trubisky wins the job, he'll likely be looking over his shoulder all season. The Bears did little to improve a below-average offensive line, only adding free-agent Germain Ifedi, a first-round bust in Seattle. Allen Robinson is the only dependable playmaker to target downfield. Trubisky's fantasy advantage over Foles is his rushing production, but if that doesn't bounce back, then what?

Jones wasn't officially named the starter by new coach Bruce Arians until Week 10 last season, but he was productive when he got the touches, showing improved ability as a receiver and using his speed, burst and elusiveness to make defenses pay if they didn't wrap him up quickly. His broken tackle rate - one every 7.5 carries - ranked fifth among qualified rushers, and his 2.4 after-contact average was 13th. His blocking remained poor, however, and he was often replaced by Dare Ogunbowale on passing downs, a serious issue in an offense where it seemed like every down was a passing down. Jones likely remains atop the depth chart for the start of training camp, but rookie third-round pick Ke'Shawn Vaughn could quickly prove himself an upgrade on former backfield mate Peyton Barber (now in Washington). With Tom Brady under center and the defense making strides late last season, the Bucs should have a better run/pass balance, rather than reprising 2019's pass-heavy, high-risk approach. Increased volume could allow Jones to push for his first 1,000-yard season, but he'll first need to fend off competition from Vaughn."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"15965c39-17be-4338-911a-8f337f48a3ce"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6163,"away":{"abbreviation":"TB","location":"Tampa Bay","name":"Buccaneers"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NO","location":"New Orleans","name":"Saints"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600028700000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":103.9375,"formatted":"103.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":7,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":10.787499,"formatted":"10.8"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":149.8,"formatted":"149.8"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":724.0,"formatted":"724"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":31.0,"formatted":"31"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":309.0,"formatted":"309"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":9.3625,"formatted":"9.36"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":95,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":26,"formatted":"26"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":91,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":34,"formatted":"RB34"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":9.6,"formatted":"9.6"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":11.13,"formatted":"11.13"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":8.42,"formatted":"8.42"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":149.8,"formatted":"149.8"},"seasonAverage":{"value":9.3625,"formatted":"9.36"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.598981,"formatted":"5.6"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":14191,"nameFull":"Gus Edwards","nameShort":"G.

On another team, his lack of wiggle and bulldozer running style - not to mention his lack of receiving skills - might restrict him to a short-yardage role or even practice squad status. In Baltimore, Edwards offers an ideal complement to the threat posed by Lamar Jackson in the open field, and he's averaged more  than five yards per carry as the guy who punches the defense in the face when it's expecting a dance. Edwards' success is also based on him knowing his limitations, and no back in the league bounced a lower percentage of their runs outside the tackles last season. That success won't save his spot on the depth chart, though. Mark Ingram remains the starter, and the surprise addition of J.K. Dobbins in the second round of this year's draft gives the Ravens a younger, more talented option for that smash-mouth role.

At 6-4, 198, and with blazing 4.34 speed, a 40-inch vertical leap and 129-inch broad jump, Chark's physical tools are approaching Randy Moss territory. While he had only one catch of 40-plus yards, Chark caught 17 for 20-plus (T-9th), and there's little doubt he's fast enough to stretch the field. He didn't see a ton of work in the red zone (15 total targets, six from inside the 10) but still scored eight touchdowns and had only four drops all year. With Nick Foles in Chicago, it should be second-year quarterback Gardner Minshew's team all offseason, and he should get better and improve his rapport with the Jags' top receiver. The Jaguars drafted bruiser Laviska Shenault in the second round, and Dede Westbrook is still around, but they're more likely to compete with one another and Chris Conley than cut into Chark's secured role. Finally, the Jaguars offense should improve under new offensive coordinator Jay Gruden, who hasn't had a young receiver with this type of size and speed since he coached A.J.

Part of that was due to Cam Newton being out most of the season and Kyle Allen not being an adequate replacement, but D.J. Moore's efficiency wasn't similarly affected. All told, Samuel managed 11.6 YPC and a meager 6.0 YPT, last among the league's 30 100-target receivers. As a result, the Panthers signed deep threat Robby Anderson to a twoyear deal, likely pushing Samuel to the No. 3 option, and that's not counting tailback Christian McCaffrey and his 142 targets. While newly signed Teddy Bridgewater should be an upgrade from Allen, it's hard to see him generating enough offense for four productive pass catchers.

Initially sidelined by a four-game suspension, Herndon then injured his hamstring two days before he was to make his season debut. He didn't play until Week 10, when he suffered a broken rib that sent him to IR. Meanwhile, fellow tight end Ryan Griffin caught five TDs, earning a threeyear, $9.55 million extension. Herndon may now find himself battling for a starting job, though a closer look at his rookie season inspires optimism. The fourth-round pick became one of just 12 TEs in the last 20 years to reach 500 yards as a rookie, and he did it with a 10.0 aDOT that was third-deepest among 17 TEs with 50-plus targets. Herndon accrued more than two-thirds of his yards in the second half of the season, and his mark of 1.65 yards per route would translate to TE1 value in an every-down role (he was limited to 39 snaps and 19 routes per game). Jets coach Adam Gase does expect his tight ends to pass block, but the Jets aren't exactly loaded with receiving talent, so Herndon could still be a primary target for Sam Darnold."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"externalIds":[{"id":"780a48de-d092-4e87-9c34-8d1b45a154cc"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6155,"away":{"abbreviation":"NYJ","location":"New York","name":"Jets"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BUF","location":"Buffalo","name":"Bills"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":35.9375,"formatted":"35.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":0.3125,"formatted":"0.3"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":3,"mean":{"value":4.63125,"formatted":"4.6"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":7.0,"formatted":"7"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"formatted":"0"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388917,"name":"TMT"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":514,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":112,"formatted":"112","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":158,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":21,"formatted":"TE21"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":1.2,"formatted":"1.2"}},{"proPlayer":{"id":14731,"nameFull":"Jace Sternberger","nameShort":"J.

His 4,902 passing yards, which fell one yard short of the franchise single-season record, ranked second in the NFL, and he also finished fourth in TD passes (30) and fifth in YPA (8.2). His career year was due in part to refined throwing mechanics, improved footwork and better weight distribution that he said allowed him to get more torque on the ball. That helped him improve his bad-pass percentage to 18.5 (7th), and his 65.1 completion percentage (13th) would have been higher had it not been for a league-leading 43 dropped passes - 7.2 percent, highest among QBs with at least 300 attempts. He also increased his average depth of target by nearly two full yards - 8.0 to 9.9, ranking fourth. After struggling in the red zone in 2018, he improved his TD percentage by nearly 10 points to 26.2, but the Cowboys didn't pass much in the red zone (27th), especially inside the 10 (29th). Perhaps that changes with new head coach Mike McCarthy, though OC Kellen Moore is back for his second season after taking the offense from 22nd to first in yards last season. The dual-threat Prescott again has quality receivers in Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and first-round pick CeeDee Lamb, plus elite RB Ezekiel Elliott. And even with center Travis Frederick retiring, Dallas still has a star-studded O-line. The biggest issue might be Prescott's contract, though his decision to sign a franchise tag suggests he isn't anticipating a holdout."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"externalIds":[{"id":"86197778-8d4b-4eba-affe-08ef7be7c70b"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"QB","categories":[{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"rank":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":245.5,"formatted":"245.5"}}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"rank":{"rank":15,"mean":{"value":1.4375,"formatted":"1.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":11,"mean":{"value":18.115625,"formatted":"18.1"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":333.77997,"formatted":"333.78"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":12,"abbreviation":"%","namePlural":"Completion Percentage"},"value":{"value":65.10067,"formatted":"65.1"}},{"category":{"id":3,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Passing Yards"},"value":{"value":4902.0,"formatted":"4,902"}},{"category":{"id":5,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Passing TDs"},"value":{"value":30.0,"formatted":"30"}},{"category":{"id":7,"abbreviation":"INT","namePlural":"Interceptions","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":11.0,"formatted":"11"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":20.861248,"formatted":"20.86"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"PASSER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":3,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":2,"formatted":"2","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":54,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"QB","group":"START","eligibility":["QB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_RED"]},"ordinal":3,"formatted":"QB3","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":29.62,"formatted":"29.62"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":19.2,"formatted":"19.2"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":19.35,"formatted":"19.35"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":333.77997,"formatted":"333.78"},"seasonAverage":{"value":20.861248,"formatted":"20.86"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":7.619821,"formatted":"7.62"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12102,"nameFull":"Jared Goff","nameShort":"J.

He had 65 more pass attempts than the year before but came up 50 yards short of his 2018 total as his YPA dropped a full yard from 8.4 to 7.4. Worse, he threw 10 fewer touchdown passes while tossing a career-high 16 interceptions. Goff's two biggest problems were the red zone and downfield passing. In the case of the former, the Rams had 21 fewer red-zone trips (80 vs. 59) than the previous year, and Goff lost five touchdown passes despite a slight uptick in red-zone TD pass percentage. His downfield passing was even more worrisome. On nearly the same number of attempts as 2018 (55 vs. 51), Goff totaled nearly 400 fewer yards on passes of more than 20 yards, his touchdowns on such throws falling from seven to one. WR Brandin Cooks' injury woes are partly responsible for that decline, but the Rams didn't replace his speed this offseason after trading him to the Texans. Wide receivers Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods and Josh Reynolds return, though none is a field-stretcher. Nor is second-round draft pick Van Jefferson, who averaged 12.3 yards per catch in college. On the plus side, Goff might get more help from the running game with Todd Gurley and his bad knee gone to Atlanta, and the Rams still have a quality tight-end duo in Tyler Higbee and Gerald Everett.

A knee injury suffered Week 7 required surgery and cost him eight games, sabotaging a solid start to the season that had seen him pile up 411 yards and three TDs in the Lions' first five games. Johnson showed improved chemistry with Matthew Stafford to begin the year, averaging nearly 10 yards per target through those first five games, but his physical running style has proven a poor match for his slightly undersized frame (5-11, 206). After bringing in veterans behind Johnson the last two years, Detroit sprung for an early draft pick in the backfield this offseason, nabbing D'Andre Swift at No. 35 overall. The Georgia product is a better prospect than Johnson was as a second-round pick in 2018, carrying more weight (212) in a shorter frame (5-8) while boasting 4.48 speed and a college average of 6.6 YPC. Swift also offers three-down potential after averaging 24.3 catches, 222 yards and 1.7 touchdowns in his three seasons as a Bulldog. With Bo Scarbrough and fifth-round pick Jason Huntley lingering at the bottom of the depth chart, Johnson suddenly finds himself in a crowded backfield where he no longer holds the advantage in pedigree."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"externalIds":[{"id":"6faa5a10-56b8-4dd0-b8de-0cf1378b6726"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6160,"away":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":9,"mean":{"value":127.875,"formatted":"127.9"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.0625,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":20,"mean":{"value":14.1625,"formatted":"14.2"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":80.0,"formatted":"80"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"},"value":{"value":403.0,"formatted":"403"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":127.0,"formatted":"127"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":181,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":53,"formatted":"53","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":108,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":41,"formatted":"RB41","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":11.3,"formatted":"11.3"},"duration":1},{"value":{"value":6.13,"formatted":"6.13"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":9.24,"formatted":"9.24"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":80.0,"formatted":"80"},"seasonAverage":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":4.497777,"formatted":"4.5"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13814,"nameFull":"Derrius Guice","nameShort":"D.

Even after returning in Week 11, he lasted only four games before suffering yet another knee injury, his third in two NFL seasons. The latest issue didn't require surgery, but it's still a disconcerting trend for the 2018 second-round pick. When healthy, Guice flashed the power and speed that made him such a prized commodity coming out of LSU, and his average of 4.6 yards after contact was outstanding, albeit over a tiny sample. Washington has plenty of insurance on hand in case of another breakdown, after bringing back Adrian Peterson, drafting versatile Memphis speedster Antonio Gibson in the third round and signing veterans Peyton Barber and J.D. McKissic. Last year's fourth-round pick, Bryce Love, also remains a wild card if he can overcome his own knee woes.

He notched 8.7 YPT (13th) and dropped only three passes. He made big plays (four catches of 40-plus yards) but didn't get into the end zone often, thanks to his modest red-zone use (12 targets, only two inside the 10). Moreover, Moore's rushing stats - 172 yards on 13 carries as a rookie - crashed to 40 yards on only six carries in his sophomore campaign. At 5-11, 215, and running a 4.42 40, Moore is stout, compact and unusually fast for a receiver his height and weight. He has good open-field vision and is dangerous after the catch. The acquisition of new quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is likely to be a boost, not because he's anything special as a passer, but because he's light years ahead of last year's QB, Kyle Allen, and his accuracy and care with the football should help keep the offense moving more reliably than it did last season. Plus, new coach Matt Rhule (and OC Joe Brady) could install a more pass-friendly scheme than what the Panthers had in recent seasons under Ron Rivera. Moore figures to be the team's top WR target again, but the Panthers signed deep threat Robby Anderson to a twoyear deal this offseason and bring back tailback Christian McCaffrey and fourth-year man Curtis Samuel, providing sturdy competition for Bridgewater's attention."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"externalIds":[{"id":"d8202e6d-d03b-4cd1-a793-ff8fd39d9755"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6154,"away":{"abbreviation":"LV","location":"Las Vegas","name":"Raiders"},"home":{"abbreviation":"CAR","location":"Carolina","name":"Panthers"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":167.5625,"formatted":"167.6"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":23,"mean":{"value":1.125,"formatted":"1.1"},"rating":"RATING_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":28,"mean":{"value":11.1875,"formatted":"11.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":186.00002,"formatted":"186"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":87.0,"formatted":"87"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1175.0,"formatted":"1,175"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":4.0,"formatted":"4"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":12.400001,"formatted":"12.4"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":61,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":18,"formatted":"18","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":35,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":15,"formatted":"WR15","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":0.6,"formatted":"0.6"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":8.67,"formatted":"8.67"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":14.12,"formatted":"14.12"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":186.00002,"formatted":"186"},"seasonAverage":{"value":12.400001,"formatted":"12.4"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.970037,"formatted":"5.97"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13795,"nameFull":"Courtland Sutton","nameShort":"C.

At 6-3, 218, Sutton is a downfield playmaker despite average timed speed (4.54 40).

Sutton was also active in the red zone with 20 targets (T-8th), including nine from inside the 10 (T-9th), and he tied for the league lead in pass interference penalties drawn with eight. Of some concern is Sutton's drop-off once Emmanuel Sanders was traded - his per-game numbers fell by 1.1 catches and 19.7 yards. But Sutton will have two strong complements - and also more competition for targets - after the Broncos drafted Jerry Jeudy in the first and KJ Hamler in the second round. Hamler profiles more as a slot receiver and deep threat, while Jeudy will run routes all over the field opposite Sutton. Suddenly, second-year quarterback Drew Lock has a loaded offense, which includes 2019 first-round pick Noah Fant at tight end and free-agent signee Melvin Gordon in the backfield, but Sutton is still the favorite to lead the team in targets."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"externalIds":[{"id":"b55ae5ba-593f-4560-9cab-14e10698e01d"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6166,"away":{"abbreviation":"TEN","location":"Tennessee","name":"Titans"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DEN","location":"Denver","name":"Broncos"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600135800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":18,"mean":{"value":163.3125,"formatted":"163.3"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":0.75,"formatted":"0.7"}}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":16,"mean":{"value":9.475,"formatted":"9.5"}}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":184.41998,"formatted":"184.42"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":72.0,"formatted":"72"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":1112.0,"formatted":"1,112"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.526249,"formatted":"11.53"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":62,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":19,"formatted":"19","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":42,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":19,"formatted":"WR19","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":6.2,"formatted":"6.2"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":7.57,"formatted":"7.57"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":10.0,"formatted":"10"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":184.41998,"formatted":"184.42"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.526249,"formatted":"11.53"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.4557405,"formatted":"5.46"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13782,"nameFull":"Anthony Miller","nameShort":"A.

Like last year, Miller had offseason surgery to address chronic left shoulder problems, but he should be ready for the start of camp."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"externalIds":[{"id":"bfaedf99-7618-4925-b362-90415c22a3b6"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6160,"away":{"abbreviation":"CHI","location":"Chicago","name":"Bears"},"home":{"abbreviation":"DET","location":"Detroit","name":"Lions"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"WR","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":31,"mean":{"value":190.875,"formatted":"190.9"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":1.375,"formatted":"1.4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":11.028125,"formatted":"11"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":101.5,"formatted":"101.5"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":52.0,"formatted":"52"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":656.0,"formatted":"656"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":6.34375,"formatted":"6.34"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":143,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":58,"formatted":"58","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":112,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"WR","group":"START","eligibility":["WR"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_BLUE"]},"ordinal":46,"formatted":"WR46"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":1.0,"formatted":"1"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"},"duration":3},{"value":{"value":10.84,"formatted":"10.84"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":101.5,"formatted":"101.5"},"seasonAverage":{"value":6.34375,"formatted":"6.34"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.5894766,"formatted":"6.59"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12069,"nameFull":"Austin Hooper","nameShort":"A.

While Hooper, who runs a 4.72 40, is no athletic match for the likes of George Kittle and Travis Kelce, he should be a useful target on short and intermediate passes for Baker Mayfield. The No. 1 overall pick is hoping to rebound from a sophomore slump, surrounded by a new coaching staff in an offense loaded with name-brand weapons. The 25-year-old Hooper will make the team better, but we can't ignore how his 2019 production largely occurred when the Falcons were in catch-up mode, often against defenses focused on mitigating Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley. Hooper produced 62 percent of his yardage and five of his six TDs after halftime, and he averaged 79.6 yards and 9.9 YPT in seven losses, compared to 38.3 yards and 5.6 YPT in six wins (he also missed three games with an MCL sprain). Even amidst a breakout season, only two of Hooper's 75 receptions came on passes thrown 20-plus yards downfield. In Cleveland, the presence of Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt and fellow tight end David Njoku will make it difficult for opponents to focus on Hooper, potentially helping his efficiency but also leaving him as a long shot to match last year's 7.5 targets per game. The question now is whether Hooper can do more with less."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"externalIds":[{"id":"90c2a93f-d837-4e1b-b57c-56648903a8db"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6159,"away":{"abbreviation":"CLE","location":"Cleveland","name":"Browns"},"home":{"abbreviation":"BAL","location":"Baltimore","name":"Ravens"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":3,"mean":{"value":35.9375,"formatted":"35.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":2,"mean":{"value":0.1875,"formatted":"0.2"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":1,"mean":{"value":4.04375,"formatted":"4"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":154.2,"formatted":"154.2"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":75.0,"formatted":"75"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":787.0,"formatted":"787"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":6.0,"formatted":"6"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":11.861538,"formatted":"11.86"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":93,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":6,"formatted":"6","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":114,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":12,"formatted":"TE12","rating":"RATING_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":8.0,"formatted":"8"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":7.73,"formatted":"7.73"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":7.42,"formatted":"7.42"},"duration":5,"underPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":154.2,"formatted":"154.2"},"seasonAverage":{"value":11.861538,"formatted":"11.86"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.743832,"formatted":"5.74"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_GOOD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":12140,"nameFull":"Tyler Higbee","nameShort":"T.

It was actually fellow Rams tight end Gerald Everett who appeared to be breaking out at one point in the season, until his November knee injury opened the door for Higbee to handle a three-down role. He responded by closing out the season with five consecutive games with seven or more catches and 88 or more yards, averaging 11.2 targets per week. It now appears the Rams landed a bargain when they signed Higbee to a four-year, $29 million extension in September, potentially leaving Everett as the odd man out when his contract expires after 2020. There's still a degree of uncertainty for the short-term production outlook, with a healthy Everett potentially stealing some snaps, while wide receivers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp are locked in for a steady stream of short passes. Of course, there's generally been enough to go around in the Sean McVay/Jared Goff offenses, and at 6-6, 255, Higbee has always been more trusted as a blocker than Everett."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"externalIds":[{"id":"0df7912d-9e81-47ea-b4f7-d04986df4ee8"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":61.25,"formatted":"61.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":7.26875,"formatted":"7.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":125.9,"formatted":"125.9"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":69.0,"formatted":"69"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":734.0,"formatted":"734"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":3.0,"formatted":"3"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":8.992857,"formatted":"8.99"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":116,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":8,"formatted":"8","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":77,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":7,"formatted":"TE7","rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"value":18.4,"formatted":"18.4"},"duration":1,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":16.8,"formatted":"16.8"},"duration":3,"overPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":17.14,"formatted":"17.14"},"duration":5,"overPerforming":true}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":125.9,"formatted":"125.9"},"seasonAverage":{"value":8.992857,"formatted":"8.99"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":6.521445,"formatted":"6.52"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":13810,"nameFull":"Mason Rudolph","nameShort":"M.

Most of that action came in the final month of the season as Jacobs nursed a shoulder injury, and Washington accumulated 52 percent of his yards on the year during the final four games. Slightly undersized for an NFL lead back, the Texas Tech product has a three-down skill set and good speed in the open field, making him a solid complementary option. The move to Kansas City as a free agent looked a lot more promising before the Chiefs selected Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the first round of the 2020 draft, but Washington's versatility should at least put him right in the mix for a roster spot.

An explosive, elusive runner, Evans can change direction on a dime and is a home-run threat once he gets some green around him. His smaller frame and lack of power could make him ineffective between the tackles, but that's Henry's domain anyway, so it shouldn't be a big issue in Tennessee. Evans also gives good effort in pass protection and is useful enough as an outlet receiver, so he should be able to take on the passing-down role previously filled by Dion Lewis.

The community college transfer quickly worked his way from obscurity to third-round draft status, with his 2019 season yielding 38-735-8 through the air and 33-369-4 on the ground - good for second on his team in both rushing and receiving yards. Just for good measure, Gibson averaged 28 yards on 23 kick returns, adding a 13th TD on special teams. While his combine workouts were otherwise average, a 4.39 40 from a man his size will inevitably turn a lot of heads. The problem, at least for now, is figuring out where Gibson fits, not only in terms of position but specifically within the context of the Washington offense. Coach Ron Rivera said he wants to see Gibson in the backfield, where the team already had Derrius Guice, Adrian Peterson, Bryce Love, J.D. McKissic and Peyton Barber. Perhaps the team views Gibson as a passing-down specialist, but even then, he'd likely need to battle McKissic. Of course, Gibson has draft capital and athleticism working in his favor, so there's some upside to be had if the team finds a nice role for him."}},"hasLockedPremiumContent":true,"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"externalIds":[{"id":"c0a8a5d0-583f-457a-9d96-70027d3f69e7"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6157,"away":{"abbreviation":"PHI","location":"Philadelphia","name":"Eagles"},"home":{"abbreviation":"WAS","location":"Washington","name":"Redskins"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"RB","categories":[{"category":{"id":28,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Scrimmage Yards"},"rank":{"rank":5,"mean":{"value":109.875,"formatted":"109.9"},"rating":"RATING_BAD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":7,"mean":{"value":0.6875,"formatted":"0.7"},"rating":"RATING_BAD","isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":12,"mean":{"value":12.306251,"formatted":"12.3"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":22,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Rushing Yards"}},{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RUSHER","rankDraft":{"ordinal":180,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"RB","group":"START","eligibility":["RB"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_GREEN"]},"ordinal":58,"formatted":"RB58","rating":"RATING_VERY_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15620,"nameFull":"Ke'Shawn Vaughn","nameShort":"K.

Solidly built at 5-9, 214, Vaughn runs with power and surprising speed in the open field thanks to his background as a sprinter in high school, and he has the balance to survive initial contact. He lacks elusiveness, however, and while he's a willing blocker, his receiving skills need some work - limitations that could keep him on the sideline for passing downs and give him fewer chances to make use of his 4.51 speed. Paired with Ronald Jones in the Tampa Bay backfield, Vaughn could thrive if defenses are forced to back off and respect the new Tom Brady-led passing attack, but Jones has the advantage of being in his second year under coach Bruce Arians. There's also the matter of a backfield committee potentially including a third player, with Dare Ogunbowale and seventh-round rookie Raymond Calais competing for a role on passing downs.

He has a chance to be their No. 1 wideout before long, especially if they find a taker for Alshon Jeffery. At 5-10, 206, Reagor is stout and compact, and while he ran an above-average 4.47 40 at the combine, he plays even faster on the field. His vertical leap (42 inches) and broad jump (138 inches) show off-the-charts athleticism too. Reagor's college production appears less impressive, until we consider the QB play he dealt with at TCU. Reagor was the Horned Frogs' leading receiver in three consecutive seasons, including a 1,000-yard campaign (2018) in an offense where no one else reached 500. The Eagles typically have spread the ball around in recent years, and tight end Zach Ertz is still the safe bet to lead them in targets, but they didn't draft Reagor in the first round to make him a complement in a committee.

Jefferson was a monster at LSU last year with 1,540 yards and 18 touchdowns on 111 catches.

Smith started 14 of his 16 games and played at least 72 percent of snaps every week after Delanie Walker suffered a season-ending injury in October. Unfortunately, the steady playing time and impressive efficiency didn't translate to consistent production, as Smith averaged 30.9 receiving yards on 3.7 targets in nine regular-season games with Walker inactive, before seeing only nine targets in three playoff bouts. Part of the problem was a run-heavy Titans offense that averaged 27 pass attempts in Ryan Tannehill's 10 starts, but there was also the matter of Anthony Firkser poaching some work on passing downs, plus Smith's 79 pass-blocking snaps tied for ninth most among tight ends. While his after-the-catch brilliance seemingly demands more receiving work, there hasn't been much sign of Smith doing damage downfield, with his 5.0-yard average depth of target in 2019 ranking fourth to last among TEs (and up a tick from 4.9 in 2018).

But it turns out Everett was holding his teammate back rather than other way around, as Higbee erupted for 522 yards in five December games while Everett nursed a hyperextended knee. The official record shows Everett playing 13 games last year, but that includes Weeks 16 and 17 when he logged four snaps. Perhaps the strangest thing about this unexpected turn is that Everett had finally appeared to break through earlier in the year, averaging 4.7 catches for 53.7 yards in a six-game stretch Weeks 4-10. Granted, he did it with volume (8.2 targets per game) rather than efficiency (6.6 YPT), which perhaps explains why coach Sean McVay ended his flirtation with two-TE formations even before Everett hurt his knee. It now appears likely that the final year of Everett's rookie contract will also be his last season with the Rams, but there's a strong case to be made for McVay re-exploring those multi-TE sets after Brandin Cooks was traded to Houston. Whether Everett is competing against Higbee or wide receivers Josh Reynolds and Van Jefferson remains to be seen."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"externalIds":[{"id":"ebeceb00-57e0-4b74-9cf7-853da2afed18"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6164,"away":{"abbreviation":"DAL","location":"Dallas","name":"Cowboys"},"home":{"abbreviation":"LAR","location":"Los Angeles","name":"Rams"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600042800000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":30,"mean":{"value":61.25,"formatted":"61.2"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":0.375,"formatted":"0.4"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":26,"mean":{"value":7.26875,"formatted":"7.3"},"rating":"RATING_VERY_GOOD"}}}],"viewingActualPoints":{"value":71.30001,"formatted":"71.3"},"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"},"value":{"value":37.0,"formatted":"37"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"value":{"value":408.0,"formatted":"408"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true},"value":{"formatted":"0"}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"value":{"value":2.0,"formatted":"2"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingActualPointsAverage":{"value":5.9416676,"formatted":"5.94"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","rankFantasy":{"ordinal":195,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":26,"formatted":"26"}],"season":2019},"rankDraft":{"ordinal":208,"positions":[{"position":{"label":"TE","group":"START","eligibility":["TE"],"colors":["DRAFT_BOARD_YELLOW"]},"ordinal":30,"formatted":"TE30","rating":"RATING_BAD"}],"season":2020},"lastX":[{"value":{"formatted":"0"},"duration":1,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":1.93,"formatted":"1.93"},"duration":3,"underPerforming":true},{"value":{"value":3.82,"formatted":"3.82"},"duration":5}],"isKeeper":true,"seasonTotal":{"value":71.30001,"formatted":"71.3"},"seasonAverage":{"value":5.9416676,"formatted":"5.94"},"seasonsStandartDeviation":{"value":5.541277,"formatted":"5.54"},"seasonConsistency":"RATING_VERY_BAD"},{"proPlayer":{"id":15616,"nameFull":"Dalton Keene","nameShort":"D.

As April's NFL Draft approached, the Patriots' depth chart at the position consisted of Matt LaCosse and Ryan Izzo. With that in mind, the team doubled down by taken both Keene and Devin Asiasi in the third round. Both players have some long-term fantasy upside, but with a QB transition on tap in the wake of Tom Brady's departure, neither figures to be a reliable lineup option out of the gate. Keene posted modest volume at Virginia Tech, but his per-target efficiency was notable thanks to his standout work after the catch. With an athletic profile similar to Austin Hooper's, the 6-4, 253-pound Keene - who just turned 21 in April - has has the potential to vault both LaCosse and Asiasi and ascend to a starting job."}},"proTeam":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"externalIds":[{"id":"4da5e05d-fc5c-4e87-aa38-d9cde42dd476"}]},"requestedGames":[{"game":{"id":6158,"away":{"abbreviation":"MIA","location":"Miami","name":"Dolphins"},"home":{"abbreviation":"NE","location":"New England","name":"Patriots"},"startTimeEpochMilli":"1600016400000","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"}},"stats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"participant":"HOME","period":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"ranks":{"position":"TE","categories":[{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"},"rank":{"rank":19,"mean":{"value":53.8125,"formatted":"53.8"}}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"},"rank":{"rank":8,"mean":{"value":0.3125,"formatted":"0.3"},"isRankTied":true}}],"defaultPoints":{"rank":13,"mean":{"value":5.475,"formatted":"5.5"}}}}],"viewingActualStats":[{"category":{"id":41,"abbreviation":"Rec","namePlural":"Catches"}},{"category":{"id":42,"abbreviation":"Yd","namePlural":"Receiving Yards"}},{"category":{"id":26,"abbreviation":"Fum","namePlural":"Fumbles","lowerIsBetter":true}},{"category":{"id":29,"abbreviation":"TD","namePlural":"Offensive + Special Teams TDs"}}],"transactionStatus":{"actionable":{"trade":true},"isLineupStatusLocked":true},"requestedGamesPeriod":{"ordinal":1,"startEpochMilli":"1599559200000"},"viewingFormat":"TOTAL","viewingRange":{"season":2019,"low":1,"high":17},"owner":{"id":1388934,"name":"Pylon Pythons","logoUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/fleaflicker/t1388934_0_150x150.jpg"},"displayGroup":"RECEIVER","lastX":[{"duration":1},{"duration":3},{"duration":5}]},{"proPlayer":{"id":15645,"nameFull":"Brycen Hopkins","nameShort":"B.
